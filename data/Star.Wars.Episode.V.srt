1
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:37,383
Echo Three to Echo Seven.
Han, old buddy, do you read me?

2
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,682
<i>Loud and clear, kid.
What’s up?</i>

3
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:42,521
Well, I finished my circle.
I don’t pick up any life readings.

4
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,658
<i>There isn’t enough life on this ice cube
to fill a space cruiser.</i>

5
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,395
<i>– Sensors are placed. I’m going back.
– Right. I’ll see you shortly.</i>

6
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:53,897
There’s a meteorite that hit the ground near here.
I want to check it out. It won’t take long.

7
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,391
Steady, hey, steady, girl.
Hey, what’s the matter?

8
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,072
You smell something?

9
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,781
Chewie! Chewie?
Chewie!

10
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:53,523
All right! Don’t lose your temper.
I’ll come right back and give you a hand.

11
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,877
– Solo.
– No sign of life out there, General.

12
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,485
The sensors are in place. You’ll know
if anything comes around.

13
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:21,485
Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

14
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,855
No. He’s checking out
a meteorite that hit near him.

15
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,726
With all the meteor activity in this system,
it’s going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

16
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:31,262
– General, I’ve got to leave. I can’t stay anymore.
– I’m sorry to hear that.

17
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:34,961
Well, there’s a price on my head. If I don’t pay off
Jabba the Hutt, I’m a dead man.

18
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:39,834
A death mark’s not an easy thing to live with.
You’re a good fighter, Solo.

19
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,840
– I hate to lose you.
– Thank you, General.

20
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:54,886
– Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.
– That’s right.

21
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:00,151
Well, don’t get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

22
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,992
Han!

23
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:09,101
– Yes, Your Highnessness?
– I thought you had decided to stay.

24
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,170
Well, the bounty hunter we ran into
on Ord Mantell changed my mind.

25
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,329
Han, we need you!

26
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,776
<i>– We need?
– Yes.</i>

27
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,975
<i>– Well, what about you need?
– I need?</i>

28
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,045
– I don’t know what you’re talking about.
– You probably don’t.

29
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,619
– And what precisely am I supposed to know?
– Come on!

30
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,987
You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about me.

31
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,788
Yes! You’re a great help to us.
You’re a natural leader.

32
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:35,992
No! That’s not it.
Come on.

33
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:39,021
– A-ha! Come on.
– You’re imagining things.

34
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:41,500
Am I? Then why are you following me?

35
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,870
Afraid I was gonna leave
without giving you a good-bye kiss?

36
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,673
– I’d just as soon kiss a Wookiee!
– I can arrange that.

37
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,963
You could use a good kiss!

38
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:53,379
Don’t try to blame me. I didn’t ask you to turn on
the thermal heater. I merely commented...

39
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,678
...that it was freezing in the princess’s chamber.

40
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,084
But it’s supposed to be freezing! How we’re going
to dry out all of her clothes, I really don’t know.

41
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,055
Oh, switch off!

42
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:04,656
Why did you take this apart now?
I’m trying to get us out of here...

43
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,492
– ...and you pull both of these—
– Excuse me, sir.

44
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,961
– Put them back together, right now!
– Might I have a word with you, please?

45
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,754
– What do you want?
– Well, it’s Princess Leia, sir. She’s been trying...

46
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:14,567
– ...to get you on the communicator.
– I turned it off. I don’t want to talk to her.

47
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,903
Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.

48
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:18,904
He hasn’t come back yet.
She doesn’t know where he is.

49
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,939
– I don’t know where he is.
– Nobody knows where he is.

50
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,940
– What do you mean, nobody knows?
– Well, uh, you see—

51
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,177
– Deck Officer! Deck Officer!
– Excuse me, sir, might I—

52
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,380
– Yes, sir?
– Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?

53
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,417
I haven’t seen him. It’s possible
he came in through the south entrance.

54
00:07:31,516 --> 00:07:35,288
It’s possible? Why don’t you go find out?
It’s getting dark out there.

55
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:36,788
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,891
Excuse me, sir.
Might I inquire what’s going on?

57
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,391
Why not?

58
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,927
Impossible man. Come along, R2,
let’s find Princess Leia.

59
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:46,891
Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

60
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,644
Sir, Commander Skywalker
hasn’t come in the south entrance.

61
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,279
– He might have forgotten to check in.
– Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

62
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,483
Uh, not yet. We’re having some trouble
adapting them to the cold.

63
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,552
– We’ll have to go out on tauntauns.
– Sir, the temperature’s dropping too rapidly!

64
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:08,949
That’s right, and my friend’s out in it.

65
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,795
Your tauntaun will freeze
before you reach the first marker.

66
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:18,095
Then I’ll see you in Hell!

67
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:39,485
You must come along now, R2.
There’s really nothing more we can do.

68
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:42,062
And my joints are freezing up.

69
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,924
Don’t say things like that!
Of course we’ll see Master Luke again.

70
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:49,437
And he’ll be quite all right.
You’ll see.

71
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:53,567
Stupid little short circuit.
He’ll be quite all right.

72
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:54,091
Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no—

73
00:11:55,504 --> 00:11:58,105
Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.

74
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:02,299
Mistress Leia, R2 says he’s been
quite unable to pick up any signals...

75
00:12:02,412 --> 00:12:06,149
...although he does admit that his own range
is far too weak to abandon all hope.

76
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:10,448
Your Highness, there’s nothing more we can do
tonight. The shield doors must be closed.

77
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:13,922
– Close the doors.
– Yes, sir.

78
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:20,787
R2 says the chances of survival are 725 to 1.

79
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,840
Actually, R2 has been known
to make mistakes...

80
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:42,039
...from time to time.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

81
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:48,457
Don’t worry about Master Luke.
I’m sure he’ll be all right.

82
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:51,048
He’s quite clever, you know,
for a human being.

83
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,200
<i>Luke.</i>

84
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>Luke.</i>

85
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,200
Ben?

86
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,691
<i>– You will go to the Dagobah system.
– Dagobah system?</i>

87
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:28,861
<i>There you will learn from Yoda...</i>

88
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:32,565
<i>...the Jedi master who instructed me.</i>

89
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,466
Ben! Ben!

90
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,611
Luke! Luke!

91
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:56,625
Don’t do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here.

92
00:14:18,548 --> 00:14:23,380
– Not much time.
– Ben... Ben...

93
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,990
Hang on, kid.

94
00:14:30,692 --> 00:14:33,051
– Dagobah system.
– Whew!

95
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:38,157
– This may smell bad, kid...
– Yoda.

96
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:42,301
...but it’ll keep you warm
until I get the shelter built.

97
00:14:48,842 --> 00:14:52,243
I thought they smelled bad on the outside!

98
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:40,587
Echo Base, I’ve got something.
Not much, but it could be a life form.

99
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:48,971
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.

100
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:55,236
This is Rogue Two.
Captain Solo, do you copy?

101
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:06,423
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.

102
00:16:06,523 --> 00:16:10,423
<i>Good morning!
Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>

103
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:16,294
Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
I’ve found them. Repeat, I’ve found them.

104
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:50,225
Master Luke, sir, it’s so good
to see you fully functional again.

105
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,635
R2 expresses his relief also.

106
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,933
How ya feelin’, kid?
You don’t look so bad to me.

107
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:59,441
In fact, you look strong enough
to pull the ears off a gundark.

108
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:03,639
– Thanks to you.
– That’s two you owe me, junior.

109
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:08,249
Well, Your Worship, looks like you managed
to keep me around for a little while longer.

110
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,755
I had nothing to do with it.
General Rieekan thinks it’s dangerous...

111
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:14,887
...for any ships to leave the system
until we’ve activated the energy field.

112
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:17,760
That’s a good story.
I think you just can’t bear...

113
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:20,522
...to let a gorgeous guy like me
out of your sight.

114
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,930
I don’t know where you get
your delusions, laser brain.

115
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:29,603
Laugh it up, fuzzball...

116
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:32,441
...but you didn’t see us alone
in the south passage.

117
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:36,442
– She expressed her true feelings for me.
– My...

118
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,505
Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...

119
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:42,382
...scruffy-looking nerf herder!

120
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:45,852
Who’s scruffy-looking?

121
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,290
I must have hit pretty close to the mark
to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?

122
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:59,023
Well, I guess you don’t know
everything about women yet.

123
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,441
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

124
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,477
<i>Headquarters personnel,
report to command center.</i>

125
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,050
– Take it easy.
– Excuse us, please.

126
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:22,623
Princess, we have a visitor.

127
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:26,229
We’ve picked up something outside
the base’s Zone 12, moving east.

128
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,452
– It’s metal.
– Then it couldn’t be one of those creatures.

129
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:32,425
– Could be a speeder, one of ours.
– No... wait.

130
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:35,163
There’s something
very weak coming through.

131
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:41,577
Sir, I’m fluent in six million
forms of communication.

132
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:46,606
This signal is not used by the Alliance.
It could be an Imperial code.

133
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:53,123
It isn’t friendly, whatever it is.
Come on, Chewie, let’s check it out.

134
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:55,722
Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.

135
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,364
<i>– Afraid there’s not much left.
– What was it?</i>

136
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:37,932
<i>Droid of some kind. I didn’t hit it
that hard. Must’ve had a self-destruct.</i>

137
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:42,894
<i>– An Imperial probe droid.
– It’s a good bet the Empire knows we’re here.</i>

138
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:45,471
We’d better start the evacuation.

139
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:32,653
– Admiral.
– Yes, Captain?

140
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:37,393
I think we’ve got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment...

141
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:40,296
...from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it’s the best lead we’ve had.

142
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:44,459
We have thousands of probe droids searching
the galaxy. I want proof, not leads.

143
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,468
– The visuals indicate life readings.
– It could mean anything.

144
00:20:47,737 --> 00:20:50,099
– If we followed up every lead—
– But sir, the Hoth system...

145
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,242
– ...is supposed to be devoid of human forms.
– You’ve found something?

146
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:55,343
Yes, my lord.

147
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,944
That’s it.
The rebels are there.

148
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:03,808
My lord, there are so many
uncharted settlements.

149
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:06,689
– It could be smugglers, it could be—
– That is the system.

150
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:12,095
And I’m sure Skywalker is with them.
Set your course for the Hoth system.

151
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:16,130
– General Veers, prepare your men.
– Admiral.

152
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:25,240
Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind
to fly the speeders.

153
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:29,244
As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation
control will give clearance for immediate launch.

154
00:21:29,345 --> 00:21:30,944
Right, sir.

155
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:36,476
All right! That’s it.
Try it.

156
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:41,415
Oh! Turn it off!
Turn it off! Off!

157
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,685
Turn it off!

158
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:47,430
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-47s.

159
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,332
Well, forget the heavy equipment.
There’s plenty of time...

160
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:50,932
...to get the smaller modules
on the transports.

161
00:21:51,032 --> 00:21:53,333
– Take care, sir.
– Thanks.

162
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:59,739
Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

163
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:05,246
Okay, okay!

164
00:22:06,715 --> 00:22:08,116
Hi, kid.

165
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:10,799
There’s got to be a reason for it.
Check it at the other end.

166
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:12,987
Wait a second.

167
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:16,021
– You all right?
– Yeah.

168
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:24,701
Be careful.

169
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,564
You too.

170
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:37,089
General, there’s a fleet of Star Destroyers
coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.

171
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,349
Reroute all power to the energy shield.

172
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,390
We’ve got to hold them until
all transports are away.

173
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,542
Prepare for ground assault.

174
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:02,663
– What is it, General?
– My lord, the fleet has moved out of light speed.

175
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:06,710
ComScan has detected an energy field protecting
an area of the sixth planet...

176
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:10,145
...of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough
to deflect any bombardment.

177
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:12,815
The rebels are alerted to our presence.

178
00:23:12,914 --> 00:23:15,950
Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed
too close to the system.

179
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:20,545
– He... He felt surprise was wiser.
– He is as clumsy as he is stupid.

180
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:25,516
– General, prepare your troops for a surface attack.
– Yes, my lord.

181
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:36,467
<i>Lord Vader. The fleet has moved out of
light speed, and we’re preparing to—</i>

182
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:41,971
You have failed me
for the last time, Admiral.

183
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:44,947
<i>– Captain Piett.
– Yes, my lord?</i>

184
00:23:45,047 --> 00:23:48,073
Make ready to land our troops
beyond their energy field...

185
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:51,143
...and deploy the fleet so that
nothing gets off the system.

186
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,990
<i>– You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
– Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>

187
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:00,921
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.

188
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:03,965
The heavy transport ships will leave
as soon as they’re loaded.

189
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,266
Only two fighter escorts per ship.

190
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:09,134
The energy shield can only be opened
for a short time...

191
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:11,570
...so you’ll have to stay very close
to your transports.

192
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:13,941
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

193
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,112
The ion cannon will fire several shots...

194
00:24:16,211 --> 00:24:19,538
...to make sure that any enemy ships
will be out of your flight path.

195
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:23,920
When you’ve gotten past the energy shield,
proceed directly to the rendezvous point.

196
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,049
– Understood?
– Yeah.

197
00:24:26,221 --> 00:24:30,252
– Good luck.
– Okay. Everybody to your stations. Let’s go!

198
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:52,440
Their primary target will be the
power generators. Prepare to open shield.

199
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,648
– Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.
– Good. Our first catch of the day.

200
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,759
Stand by, ion control.

201
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,596
Fire.

202
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:26,700
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

203
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,652
<i>The first transport is away.</i>

204
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:40,190
– Feeling all right, sir?
– Just like new, Dak. How about you?

205
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:43,356
Right now I feel I could take on
the whole Empire myself.

206
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:45,932
I know what you mean.

207
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,916
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.
We’ve spotted Imperial walkers.

208
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:09,788
<i>Imperial walkers on the north ridge.</i>

209
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,381
Echo Station Five-Seven,
we’re on our way.

210
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:41,646
All right, boys, keep tight now.

211
00:26:42,023 --> 00:26:45,482
– Luke, I have no approach vector. I’m not set.
– Steady, Dak.

212
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,861
Attack pattern Delta.
Go now.

213
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
All right.
I’m coming in.

214
00:26:57,673 --> 00:26:59,673
Hobbie, you still with me?

215
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,762
That armor’s too strong for blasters.

216
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:28,336
Rogue Group,
use your harpoons and tow cables.

217
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:31,635
Go for the legs. It might be
our only chance of stopping them.

218
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,101
All right.
Stand by, Dak.

219
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, Luke, we’ve got a malfunction in
fire control. I’ll have to cut in the auxiliary.

220
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,845
Just hang on. Hang on, Dak.
Get ready to fire that tow cable.

221
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:51,424
Dak? Dak!

222
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:17,384
Yes, Lord Vader, I’ve reached
the main power generators.

223
00:28:17,685 --> 00:28:21,683
The shield will be down in moments.
You may start your landing.

224
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:27,955
– Rogue Three.
– Copy, Rogue Leader.

225
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:33,163
<i>Wedge, I’ve lost my gunner. You’ll
have to make this shot. I’ll cover for you.</i>

226
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:36,727
Set your harpoon.
Follow me on the next pass.

227
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,006
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

228
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:44,009
Steady, Rogue Two.

229
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,279
Activate harpoon.

230
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:50,217
Good shot, Janson.

231
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,157
– One more pass.
– Coming around, Wedge.

232
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:06,132
Cable out.
Let her go!

233
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:07,869
Detach cable.

234
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,769
Cable detached.

235
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,979
Come on.

236
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:28,987
– Hah! That got him!
– I see it, Wedge. Good work.

237
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:31,727
I don’t think we can protect
two transports at a time.

238
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:36,400
It’s risky, but we can’t hold out
much longer. We have no choice.

239
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:39,400
– Launch patrol.
– Evacuate remaining ground staff.

240
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,538
No, no! No.

241
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:47,802
This one goes there.
That one goes there, right?

242
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:51,813
R2, you take good care
of Master Luke now, understand?

243
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,346
And do take good care of yourself.

244
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

245
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:29,310
All troops will debark for ground assault.
Prepare to target the main generator.

246
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:36,457
– Rogue Two, are you all right?
– Yeah. I’m with you, Rogue Leader.

247
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:39,125
We’ll set harpoon.
I’ll cover for you.

248
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:44,230
– Coming around.
– Watch that cross fire, boys.

249
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:47,566
Set for position three.
Steady.

250
00:30:47,935 --> 00:30:49,736
Stay tight and low.

251
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:58,903
Hobbie!
I’ve been hit!

252
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,599
– You all right?
– Why are you still here?

253
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,861
– Heard the command center had been hit.
– You’ve got your clearance to leave.

254
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:51,200
Don’t worry, I’ll leave. First I’m gonna
get you to your ship.

255
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,200
Your Highness, we must take
this last transport. It’s our only hope.

256
00:31:54,336 --> 00:31:57,432
Send all troops in Sector 12 to the south slope
to protect the fighters.

257
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:02,509
<i>Imperial troops have entered the base.
Imperial troops have entered—</i>

258
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:06,807
– Come on. That’s it.
– Give the evacuation code signal.

259
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:12,617
– And get to your transports!
– Oh! Wait for me!

260
00:32:12,954 --> 00:32:16,179
Begin retreat!
Fall back! Fall back!

261
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:18,116
<i>– Distance to power generators?
– 17.28.</i>

262
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:29,695
Target.
Maximum firepower.

263
00:33:55,789 --> 00:33:57,490
Transport, this is Solo.

264
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,391
<i>Better take off. I can’t get to you.
I’ll get her out on the Falcon.</i>

265
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,824
B-B-But where are you going?
Come back!

266
00:34:23,384 --> 00:34:26,400
Wait! Wait for me!
Wait! Stop!

267
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:28,920
– How typical!
– Come on.

268
00:34:32,561 --> 00:34:35,463
Hurry up, Goldenrod. You’re gonna be
a permanent resident.

269
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:37,463
Wait! Wait!

270
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:58,454
– How’s this?
– Would it help if I got out and pushed?

271
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,820
– Captain Solo! Captain Solo!
– It might.

272
00:35:02,356 --> 00:35:04,786
Sir, might I suggest that you—

273
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,800
It can wait.

274
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:13,335
This bucket of bolts is never gonna
get us past that blockade.

275
00:35:13,434 --> 00:35:15,835
This baby’s got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

276
00:35:24,846 --> 00:35:28,945
Come on! Come on! Switch over.
Let’s hope we don’t have a burnout.

277
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:33,653
– See?
– Someday you’re gonna be wrong...

278
00:35:33,753 --> 00:35:35,753
...and I just hope I’m there to see it.

279
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:39,525
Punch it!

280
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:58,510
R2!

281
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:02,112
Get her ready for takeoff.

282
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:05,985
Good luck, Luke.
See you at the rendezvous.

283
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:11,755
Don’t worry, R2.
We’re going. We’re going.

284
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:26,072
There’s nothing wrong, R2.

285
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,340
I’m just setting a new course.

286
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:33,478
We’re not gonna regroup with the others.

287
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:36,409
We’re going to the Dagobah system.

288
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:39,344
Yes, R2.

289
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,981
That’s all right. I’d like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

290
00:37:02,043 --> 00:37:04,346
– I saw ’em! I saw ’em!
– Saw what?

291
00:37:04,445 --> 00:37:06,547
Star destroyers,
two of ’em coming right at us.

292
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:10,648
– Sir! Sir! Might I suggest—
– Shut him up or shut him down!

293
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,818
Check the deflector shield.

294
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:17,215
Great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.

295
00:37:21,695 --> 00:37:23,695
Take evasive action!

296
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:37,876
– Prepare to make the jump to light speed.
– But sir!

297
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,809
– They’re getting closer.
– Oh, yeah? Watch this.

298
00:37:46,186 --> 00:37:47,887
Watch what?

299
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:52,161
– I think we’re in trouble.
– If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier...

300
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,793
...the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
It’s impossible to go to light speed.

301
00:37:56,264 --> 00:37:58,164
We’re in trouble.

302
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:03,969
Horizontal boosters!

303
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:07,172
Alluvial dampers.

304
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,637
Ow! That’s not it.
Bring me the hydrospanners!

305
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,518
I don’t know how we’re gonna
get out of this one.

306
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,782
Ow! Chewie!

307
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:28,900
That wasn’t a laser blast.
Something hit us.

308
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,900
Han, get up here!

309
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,800
Come on, Chewie!

310
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,300
– Asteroids.
– Oh, no.

311
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:41,840
– Chewie, set two-seven-one.
– What are you doing?

312
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:48,246
– You’re not actually going into an asteroid field!
– They’d be crazy to follow us, wouldn’t they?

313
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:54,286
– You don’t have to do this to impress me.
– Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating...

314
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:58,987
– ...an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1.
– Never tell me the odds!

315
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:23,400
Look! Oh!

316
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:30,056
You said you wanted to be around when I made
a mistake. Well, this could be it, sweetheart.

317
00:39:30,155 --> 00:39:34,829
I take it back. We’re going to get pulverized
if we stay out here much longer.

318
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:37,731
– Ain’t gonna argue with that.
– Pulverized?

319
00:39:37,831 --> 00:39:39,867
– I’m going in closer to one of the big ones.
– Closer?!

320
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,768
Closer?!

321
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:11,956
– Oh, this is suicide!
– There. That looks pretty good.

322
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:16,235
– What looks pretty good?
– Yeah, that’ll do nicely.

323
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:19,431
Excuse me, ma’am,
but where are we going?

324
00:40:29,851 --> 00:40:33,146
– I hope you know what you’re doing.
– Yeah, me too.

325
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:44,231
Yep, that’s it. Dagobah.

326
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,898
No, I’m not gonna change my mind about this.

327
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,599
I’m not picking up any cities or technology.

328
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,603
Massive life-form readings, though.
There’s something alive down there.

329
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,148
Yes. I’m sure it’s perfectly safe for droids.

330
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:14,286
I know! I know!
All the scopes are dead. I can’t see a thing.

331
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:17,527
Just hang on. I’m gonna start
the landing cycle.

332
00:42:11,652 --> 00:42:14,317
No, R2, you stay put.
I’ll have a look around.

333
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,061
R2? R2!

334
00:42:24,264 --> 00:42:26,565
Where are you?

335
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:30,469
R2!

336
00:42:37,478 --> 00:42:39,677
You be more careful.

337
00:42:41,882 --> 00:42:44,382
R2, that way.

338
00:43:12,547 --> 00:43:14,146
R2!

339
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:43,043
Oh, no.

340
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,346
Are you all right?
Come on.

341
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,780
You’re lucky you don’t taste very good.

342
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:55,052
Anything broken?

343
00:43:57,925 --> 00:44:01,795
If you’re saying coming here was a bad idea,
I’m beginning to agree with you.

344
00:44:03,065 --> 00:44:05,690
R2, what are we doing here?

345
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:11,228
It’s like... something out of a dream or...

346
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:15,106
I don’t know.
Maybe I’m just going crazy.

347
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,536
– Yes, Admiral?
– Our ships have sighted...

348
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:54,516
<i>...the Millennium Falcon, lord, but it has
entered an asteroid field, and we cannot risk—</i>

349
00:44:54,615 --> 00:45:00,282
Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.
I want that ship, not excuses.

350
00:45:01,054 --> 00:45:02,755
Yes, lord.

351
00:45:07,594 --> 00:45:10,664
I’m gonna shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

352
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:14,702
Sir, I’m almost afraid to ask, but...
does that include shutting me down, too?

353
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:18,798
<i>No. I need you to talk to the Falcon.
Find out what’s wrong with the hyperdrive.</i>

354
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:30,380
Sir, it’s quite possible
this asteroid is not entirely stable.

355
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:34,585
Not entirely stable? I’m glad you’re here
to tell us these things.

356
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:38,188
Chewie, take the professor in the back
and plug him into the hyperdrive.

357
00:45:38,726 --> 00:45:40,960
Sometimes I just don’t
understand human behavior.

358
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:43,429
After all, I’m only trying
to do my job in the most...

359
00:45:48,635 --> 00:45:50,436
– Let go.
– Shh!

360
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:54,137
– Let go, please.
– Don’t get excited.

361
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:58,007
Captain, being held by you isn’t quite enough
to get me excited.

362
00:45:58,378 --> 00:46:02,414
Sorry, sweetheart. I haven’t got time
for anything else.

363
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,019
What? Ready for some power?
Okay.

364
00:46:44,525 --> 00:46:48,454
Let’s see now. Put that in there.
There you go.

365
00:46:51,597 --> 00:46:55,759
Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...
if he even exists.

366
00:47:02,242 --> 00:47:06,072
It’s really a strange place
to find a Jedi master.

367
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:09,047
This place gives me the creeps.

368
00:47:12,485 --> 00:47:14,085
Still...

369
00:47:15,556 --> 00:47:17,755
...there’s something familiar about this place.

370
00:47:19,494 --> 00:47:21,989
I don’t know.
I feel like...

371
00:47:22,163 --> 00:47:26,025
– Feel like what?
– Like we’re being watched!

372
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,061
Away put your weapon!
I mean you no harm.

373
00:47:30,338 --> 00:47:33,072
I am wondering...
why are you here?

374
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:37,644
– I’m looking for someone.
– Looking?

375
00:47:37,744 --> 00:47:40,543
Found someone you have,
I would say, hmmm?

376
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,599
Right.

377
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:47,300
Help you I can.
Yes, mmmm.

378
00:47:47,721 --> 00:47:51,693
I don’t think so.
I’m looking for a great warrior.

379
00:47:51,793 --> 00:47:54,992
Ah!
A great warrior.

380
00:47:57,864 --> 00:48:00,164
Wars not make one great.

381
00:48:08,876 --> 00:48:12,268
Put that down, now we—
Hey! That’s my dinner!

382
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:18,286
How you get so big eating food of this kind?

383
00:48:18,385 --> 00:48:22,257
Listen, friend, we didn’t mean to land in that puddle,
and if we could get our ship out, we would.

384
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:25,458
– But we can’t, so why don’t you just—
– Ah, cannot get your ship out.

385
00:48:25,726 --> 00:48:28,326
– Hey, get out of there!
– Ah!

386
00:48:28,596 --> 00:48:32,896
– No! Aww...
– Hey, you could have broken this.

387
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,199
Don’t do that.

388
00:48:36,905 --> 00:48:38,463
Oh!

389
00:48:45,612 --> 00:48:47,813
You’re making a mess.

390
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:53,913
– Hey, give me that!
– Mine, or I will help you not.

391
00:48:54,288 --> 00:48:56,201
I don’t want your help.
I want my lamp back.

392
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,501
I’m gonna need it
to get out of this slimy mudhole.

393
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:01,963
Mudhole? Slimy?
My home this is!

394
00:49:02,063 --> 00:49:04,753
Wha... Mmm!

395
00:49:05,132 --> 00:49:07,331
R2, let him have it.

396
00:49:09,103 --> 00:49:11,902
– Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
– R2!

397
00:49:15,608 --> 00:49:18,679
Now, will you move along, little fellow?
We’ve got a lot of work to do.

398
00:49:18,778 --> 00:49:23,483
No! No, no! Stay and help you I will...
find your friend. Hmm?

399
00:49:24,351 --> 00:49:27,251
I’m not looking for a friend.
I’m looking for a Jedi master.

400
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:31,621
Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.

401
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:34,454
– You seek Yoda.
– You know him?

402
00:49:34,728 --> 00:49:37,965
Mmmm.
Take you to him I will.

403
00:49:39,532 --> 00:49:42,661
Yes, yes, but now we must eat. Come.

404
00:49:43,737 --> 00:49:45,871
Good food.
Come.

405
00:49:55,282 --> 00:49:57,083
Come, come.

406
00:49:58,918 --> 00:50:03,054
R2... stay and watch after the camp.

407
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:18,800
Oh! Where is R2 when I need him?

408
00:50:19,072 --> 00:50:21,943
Sir, I don’t know where your ship
learned to communicate...

409
00:50:22,043 --> 00:50:25,847
...but it has the most peculiar dialect.
I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling...

410
00:50:25,947 --> 00:50:29,972
...on the negative axis has been polarized.
I’m afraid you’ll have to replace it.

411
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,650
Well, of course I’ll have to replace it.

412
00:50:34,387 --> 00:50:36,387
Here... and Chewie?

413
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:41,086
I think we’d better replace
the negative power coupling.

414
00:51:03,382 --> 00:51:06,119
Hey, Your Worship, I’m only trying to help.

415
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:10,782
– Would you please stop calling me that?
– Sure, Leia.

416
00:51:11,057 --> 00:51:14,961
– You make it so difficult sometimes.
– I do. I really do.

417
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:17,931
You could be a little nicer, though.

418
00:51:18,032 --> 00:51:20,932
Come on, admit it.
Sometimes you think I’m all right.

419
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:24,936
Occasionally... maybe...

420
00:51:25,206 --> 00:51:27,599
...when you aren’t acting like a scoundrel.

421
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:31,068
Scoundrel? Scoundrel?

422
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:35,940
I like the sound of that.

423
00:51:36,217 --> 00:51:38,746
– Stop that.
– Stop what?

424
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:40,913
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.

425
00:51:41,188 --> 00:51:43,422
My hands are dirty, too.
What are you afraid of?

426
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,460
– Afraid?
– You’re trembling.

427
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,960
I’m not trembling.

428
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,858
You like me because I’m a scoundrel.
There aren’t enough scoundrels in your life.

429
00:51:55,135 --> 00:51:58,527
– I happen to like nice men.
– I’m nice men.

430
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:00,905
No, you’re not. You’re—

431
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,840
Sir, sir! I’ve isolated
the reverse power flux coupling!

432
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,753
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

433
00:52:11,853 --> 00:52:14,052
Oh, you’re perfectly welcome, sir.

434
00:52:19,893 --> 00:52:22,963
<i>And that, Lord Vader, was the last time
they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>

435
00:52:23,063 --> 00:52:25,900
<i>Considering the amount of damage we’ve
sustained, they must have been destroyed.</i>

436
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,764
No, Captain.
They’re alive.

437
00:52:29,536 --> 00:52:33,802
I want every ship available to sweep
the asteroid field until they are found.

438
00:52:38,244 --> 00:52:40,144
Lord Vader.

439
00:52:40,346 --> 00:52:42,550
– Yes, Admiral. What is it?
– The Emperor commands you...

440
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,152
...to make contact with him.

441
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:48,889
Move the ship out of the asteroid field
so that we can send a clear transmission.

442
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:50,889
Yes, my lord.

443
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,635
What is thy bidding, my master?

444
00:53:10,844 --> 00:53:13,835
<i>There is a great disturbance in the Force.</i>

445
00:53:14,514 --> 00:53:18,282
<i>– I have felt it.
– We have a new enemy...</i>

446
00:53:18,751 --> 00:53:20,751
<i>...Luke Skywalker.</i>

447
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:44,650
<i>– Yes, my master.
– He could destroy us.</i>

448
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:49,822
He’s just a boy. Obi-Wan
can no longer help him.

449
00:53:50,697 --> 00:53:55,197
<i>The Force is strong with him.
The son of Skywalker...</i>

450
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:58,101
<i>...must not become a Jedi.</i>

451
00:53:58,672 --> 00:54:03,139
If he could be turned, he would
become a powerful ally.

452
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,606
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

453
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,679
<i>He would be a great asset.
Can it be done?</i>

454
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:17,188
He will join us or die, master.

455
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:39,376
Look, I’m sure it’s delicious. I just don’t
understand why we can’t see Yoda now.

456
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:43,777
Patience! For the Jedi,
it is time to eat as well.

457
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,353
Eat, eat.

458
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:50,954
Hot!

459
00:54:58,596 --> 00:55:00,500
Good food!
Mmm, good, hmm?

460
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:03,425
How far away is Yoda?
Will it take us long to get there?

461
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:08,534
Not far. Yoda not far.
Patience. Soon you will be with him.

462
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:14,076
Root leaf.
I cook.

463
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:18,581
Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm?

464
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:24,621
– Mostly because of my father, I guess.
– Ah, father. Powerful Jedi was he.

465
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:28,722
– Hee hee. Mmm, powerful Jedi.
– Oh, come on.

466
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,795
How could you know my father?
You don’t even know who I am.

467
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:35,695
I don’t even know what I’m doing here.
We’re wasting our time!

468
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:41,137
I cannot teach him.
The boy has no patience.

469
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,867
<i>He will learn patience.</i>

470
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:45,742
Hmm...

471
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:53,115
Much anger in him...
like his father.

472
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,949
<i>Was I any different
when you taught me?</i>

473
00:55:58,322 --> 00:56:02,059
No. He is not ready.

474
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,760
Yoda.

475
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:09,963
I am ready. I... Ben...
I can be a Jedi.

476
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:12,969
– Ben, tell him I’m read—
– Ready, are you?

477
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,369
What know you ready?

478
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,840
For 800 years have I trained Jedi.

479
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:24,413
My own counsel will I keep
on who is to be trained.

480
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,146
A Jedi must have
the deepest commitment, hmm?

481
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,619
The most serious mind.

482
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:36,570
This one a long time have I watched.

483
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:40,054
All his life has he looked away...

484
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:43,224
...to the future, to the horizon.

485
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:48,072
Never his mind on where he was... hmm?

486
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:51,800
What he was doing.
Hmph!

487
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,644
Adventure. Heh!
Excitement. Heh!

488
00:56:56,213 --> 00:57:01,112
A Jedi craves not these things.
You are reckless!

489
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:04,177
<i>So was I, if you remember.</i>

490
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:09,987
He is too old. Yes, too old to
begin the training.

491
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:13,561
But I’ve learned so much.

492
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,666
– Will he finish what he begins?
– I won’t fail you.

493
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,775
I’m not afraid.

494
00:57:28,413 --> 00:57:30,012
Oh...

495
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:33,148
You will be.

496
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,644
You will be.

497
00:58:18,844 --> 00:58:22,414
– Sir, if I may venture an opinion—
– I’m not really interested in your opinion, 3PO.

498
00:58:22,514 --> 00:58:24,815
There’s something out there.

499
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:26,916
– Where?
– Outside, in the cave.

500
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:29,922
There it is. Listen. Listen!

501
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:31,911
– I’m going out there.
– Are you crazy?

502
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:35,313
I just got this bucket back together.
I’m not going to let something tear it apart.

503
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:37,612
Then I’m going with you.

504
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:40,862
I think it might be better
if I stay behind and guard the ship.

505
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:42,963
Oh, no.

506
00:58:56,947 --> 00:59:00,112
This ground sure feels strange.

507
00:59:00,784 --> 00:59:03,885
It doesn’t feel like rock.

508
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,496
– There’s an awful lot of moisture in here.
– I don’t know.

509
00:59:11,596 --> 00:59:15,858
– I have a bad feeling about this.
– Yeah.

510
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:18,659
Watch out!

511
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:21,498
It’s all right.
It’s all right.

512
00:59:21,597 --> 00:59:24,106
Yeah, that’s what I thought... mynock.

513
00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:27,699
Chewie, check the rest of the ship
and make sure there are no more attached.

514
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,300
– Chewing on the power cables.
– Mynocks?

515
00:59:31,483 --> 00:59:34,447
Go on inside. We’ll clean them off
if there are any more.

516
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,199
Aagghh! Go away, go away,
beastly thing! Shoo! Shoo!

517
00:59:52,336 --> 00:59:54,436
Wait a minute...

518
01:00:16,135 --> 01:00:18,628
– All right, Chewie! Let’s get out of here!
– The Empire is still out there!

519
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:22,500
– I don’t think it’s wise to—
– No time to discuss this in committee!

520
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:24,800
I am not a committee!

521
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:32,811
You can’t make the jump to light speed
in this asteroid field.

522
01:00:32,911 --> 01:00:35,411
Sit down, sweetheart!
We’re taking off!

523
01:00:40,085 --> 01:00:41,954
– Look!
– I see it. I see it.

524
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:44,356
– We’re doomed!
– The cave is collapsing.

525
01:00:44,456 --> 01:00:46,989
– This is no cave.
– What?

526
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:20,523
Run!

527
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:24,793
Yes! A Jedi’s strength flows from the Force.

528
01:01:25,163 --> 01:01:26,998
But beware of the dark side.

529
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:31,101
Anger, fear, aggression.
The dark side of the Force are they.

530
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:34,699
Easily they flow,
quick to join you in a fight.

531
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,400
If once you start down the dark path,
forever will it dominate your destiny.

532
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,213
Consume you it will,
as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.

533
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:45,215
Vader.

534
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:49,253
– Is the dark side stronger?
– No, no.

535
01:01:49,353 --> 01:01:53,255
No. Quicker, easier, more seductive.

536
01:01:53,523 --> 01:01:55,693
But how am I to know the good side
from the bad?

537
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:59,331
You will know when you are calm...

538
01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:01,233
...at peace...

539
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,333
...passive.

540
01:02:03,668 --> 01:02:06,204
A Jedi uses the Force...

541
01:02:06,304 --> 01:02:10,079
...for knowledge and defense...
never for attack.

542
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:13,644
– But tell me why I can’t—
– No, no. There is no why.

543
01:02:13,744 --> 01:02:16,780
Nothing more will I teach you today.

544
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,405
Clear your mind of questions.

545
01:02:19,983 --> 01:02:21,784
Hmm...

546
01:02:22,721 --> 01:02:24,521
Mmm...

547
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:44,338
There’s something not right here.

548
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:50,500
I feel cold...
death.

549
01:02:50,681 --> 01:02:56,000
That place is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

550
01:02:56,153 --> 01:02:58,851
A domain of evil it is.

551
01:02:59,824 --> 01:03:02,224
In you must go.

552
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:05,099
What’s in there?

553
01:03:06,431 --> 01:03:09,431
Only what you take with you.

554
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:16,737
Your weapons...
you will not need them.

555
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:46,289
Hmph.

556
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,702
Bounty hunters. We don’t need their scum.

557
01:05:58,802 --> 01:06:02,630
– Yes, sir.
– Those rebels won’t escape us.

558
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:12,449
<i>Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer Avenger.</i>

559
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:18,250
<i>There will be a substantial reward for the one
who finds the Millennium Falcon.</i>

560
01:06:18,523 --> 01:06:21,659
You are free to use
any methods necessary...

561
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,360
...but I want them alive.
No disintegrations.

562
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:30,389
– As you wish.
– Lord Vader.

563
01:06:30,668 --> 01:06:33,264
My lord, we have them.

564
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:40,500
Oh, thank goodness we’re coming
out of the asteroid field.

565
01:06:45,382 --> 01:06:47,786
Let’s get out of here.
Ready for light speed?

566
01:06:47,885 --> 01:06:49,320
One...

567
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,855
...two...

568
01:06:50,954 --> 01:06:52,487
...three!

569
01:06:58,195 --> 01:07:00,096
It’s not fair.

570
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,170
Transfer circuits aren’t working.
It’s not my fault!

571
01:07:05,269 --> 01:07:08,635
– No light speed?
– It’s not my fault.

572
01:07:12,777 --> 01:07:14,612
Sir, we’ve just lost
the main rear deflector shield.

573
01:07:14,713 --> 01:07:17,282
One more direct hit
on the back quarter and we’re done for.

574
01:07:17,382 --> 01:07:18,882
Turn her around.

575
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:21,652
I said turn her around! I’m going
to put all power in the front shield.

576
01:07:21,753 --> 01:07:24,701
– You’re going to attack them?!
– Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault...

577
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,581
– ...on an Imperial Star Destroyer—
– Shut up!

578
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:36,766
They’re moving to attack position.

579
01:07:38,936 --> 01:07:40,637
Shields up.

580
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:48,246
Track them. They may come around
for another pass.

581
01:07:48,346 --> 01:07:51,048
Captain Needa, the ship
no longer appears on our scopes.

582
01:07:51,148 --> 01:07:55,148
They can’t have disappeared.
No ship that small has a cloaking device.

583
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,900
Well, there’s no trace of them, sir.

584
01:07:57,001 --> 01:07:59,789
Captain, Lord Vader demands
an update on the pursuit.

585
01:08:01,793 --> 01:08:03,994
Get a shuttle ready.

586
01:08:04,094 --> 01:08:08,132
I shall assume full responsibility for
losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader.

587
01:08:08,233 --> 01:08:11,432
– Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
– Yes, Captain Needa.

588
01:08:15,974 --> 01:08:19,974
Use the Force. Yes...

589
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:26,550
Now, the stone...

590
01:08:30,822 --> 01:08:32,822
Feel it.

591
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:46,435
Concentrate!

592
01:09:01,085 --> 01:09:03,954
Oh, no. We’ll never get it out now.

593
01:09:04,055 --> 01:09:06,354
So certain are you.

594
01:09:09,694 --> 01:09:13,188
Always with you it cannot be done.

595
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:18,300
– Hear you nothing that I say?
– Master, moving stones around is one thing.

596
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,600
– This is totally different.
– No! No different!

597
01:09:22,707 --> 01:09:28,106
Only different in your mind.
You must unlearn what you have learned.

598
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:33,399
– All right. I’ll give it a try.
– No! Try not.

599
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:38,184
Do. Or do not.
There is no try.

600
01:10:26,837 --> 01:10:29,703
I can’t.
It’s too big.

601
01:10:30,073 --> 01:10:32,708
Size matters not.
Look at me.

602
01:10:33,377 --> 01:10:35,712
Judge me by my size, do you?

603
01:10:35,813 --> 01:10:37,948
Hmm? Hmph!

604
01:10:38,048 --> 01:10:40,784
And well you should not...

605
01:10:40,885 --> 01:10:43,521
...for my ally is the Force.

606
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:45,822
And a powerful ally it is.

607
01:10:47,158 --> 01:10:51,386
Life creates it,
makes it grow.

608
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:58,130
Its energy surrounds us
and binds us.

609
01:10:58,269 --> 01:11:02,640
Luminous beings are we,
not this crude matter.

610
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:06,610
You must feel the Force around you...

611
01:11:06,711 --> 01:11:10,011
Here, between you, me...

612
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,252
...the tree, the rock,
everywhere!

613
01:11:14,351 --> 01:11:15,851
Yes...

614
01:11:16,253 --> 01:11:20,054
...even between the land
and the ship.

615
01:11:25,162 --> 01:11:27,261
You want the impossible.

616
01:13:14,704 --> 01:13:17,832
I don’t...
I don’t believe it.

617
01:13:18,775 --> 01:13:21,576
That is why you fail.

618
01:13:40,898 --> 01:13:45,028
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

619
01:13:52,676 --> 01:13:56,247
Lord Vader, our ships have completed
their scan of the area and found nothing.

620
01:13:56,346 --> 01:13:59,899
<i>If the Millennium Falcon went into light speed,
it’ll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.</i>

621
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,600
Alert all commands.
Calculate every possible destination...

622
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:06,100
...along their last known trajectory.

623
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:10,300
– Yes, my lord. We’ll find them.
– Don’t fail me again...

624
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,755
...Admiral.

625
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,167
Alert all commands.
Deploy the fleet.

626
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:35,617
Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far!

627
01:14:36,487 --> 01:14:39,556
No I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn’t anyone listen to me?

628
01:14:39,657 --> 01:14:41,658
The fleet’s beginning to break up.

629
01:14:41,859 --> 01:14:45,059
Go back and stand by the manual release
for the landing claw.

630
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,300
I really don’t see how that is going to help.

631
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:52,750
Surrender is a perfectly acceptable
alternative in extreme circumstances.

632
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,800
The Empire may be gracious enough to—

633
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:57,600
– Thank you.
– What’d you have in mind for your next move?

634
01:14:57,699 --> 01:15:00,600
Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure,
they’ll dump their garbage...

635
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:03,600
...before they go to light speed,
and then we just float away.

636
01:15:03,701 --> 01:15:06,400
With the rest of the garbage...
Then what?

637
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:10,054
Then we gotta find a safe port
somewhere around here.

638
01:15:10,154 --> 01:15:12,289
– Got any ideas?
– Well, where are we?

639
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:15,600
– Anoat system.
– Anoat system. There’s not much there.

640
01:15:15,699 --> 01:15:19,500
No. Well, wait.
This is interesting.

641
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,667
– Lando.
– Lando system?

642
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:26,002
Lando’s not a system.
He’s a man. Lando Calrissian.

643
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:29,903
He’s this card player, gambler, scoundrel.
You’d like him.

644
01:15:30,673 --> 01:15:34,774
– Thanks.
– Bespin. It’s pretty far, but I think we can make it.

645
01:15:35,412 --> 01:15:39,350
– A mining colony?
– Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.

646
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:41,600
Lando conned somebody out of it.

647
01:15:41,853 --> 01:15:45,252
We go back a long way, Lando and me.

648
01:15:45,756 --> 01:15:48,623
– Can you trust him?
– No.

649
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:52,429
But he’s got no love for the Empire,
I can tell you that.

650
01:15:52,529 --> 01:15:54,431
Here we go, Chewie.
Stand by.

651
01:15:54,532 --> 01:15:56,131
Detach.

652
01:16:02,672 --> 01:16:04,708
You do have your moments.

653
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:08,609
Not many of them, but you do have them.

654
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:47,039
Concentrate.
Feel the Force flow.

655
01:16:47,912 --> 01:16:49,511
Yes.

656
01:16:57,255 --> 01:16:58,922
Good.

657
01:16:59,023 --> 01:17:02,023
Calm. Yes.

658
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,430
Through the Force, things you will see.

659
01:17:05,529 --> 01:17:09,201
Other places.
The future. The past.

660
01:17:09,301 --> 01:17:12,335
Old friends long gone.

661
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:15,600
Han?

662
01:17:15,774 --> 01:17:17,474
Leia!

663
01:17:20,345 --> 01:17:22,014
Hmm...

664
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:25,613
Control, control.
You must learn control!

665
01:17:28,586 --> 01:17:32,386
I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.

666
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:36,390
Hmm...
Friends you have there.

667
01:17:37,228 --> 01:17:40,927
– They were in pain.
– It is the future you see.

668
01:17:42,466 --> 01:17:44,167
Future?

669
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:54,210
Will they die?

670
01:17:56,715 --> 01:17:58,682
Difficult to see.

671
01:17:58,783 --> 01:18:01,783
Always in motion is the future.

672
01:18:03,899 --> 01:18:06,300
I’ve got to go to them.

673
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,261
Decide you must how to serve them best.

674
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,699
If you leave now,
help them you could, but...

675
01:18:14,331 --> 01:18:18,733
...you would destroy all for which
they have fought and suffered.

676
01:18:31,716 --> 01:18:34,653
No, I don’t have a landing permit.

677
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:38,653
I’m trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

678
01:18:39,055 --> 01:18:42,894
<i>– Whoah! Wait a minute! Let me explain!
– You will not deviate from your present course.</i>

679
01:18:42,993 --> 01:18:46,094
– Rather touchy, aren’t they?
– I thought you knew this person.

680
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:52,229
Well, that was a long time ago.
I’m sure he’s forgotten about that.

681
01:18:59,976 --> 01:19:03,676
<i>Permission granted to land
on Platform 327.</i>

682
01:19:03,899 --> 01:19:05,800
Thank you.

683
01:19:06,082 --> 01:19:09,720
Nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

684
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,720
Who’s worried?

685
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:04,359
– Oh. No one to meet us.
– I don’t like this.

686
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:08,399
– What would you like?
– Well, they did let us land.

687
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:12,832
Look, don’t worry. Everything’s
gonna be fine. Trust me.

688
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:19,805
See? My friend.

689
01:20:23,845 --> 01:20:26,145
Keep your eyes open, huh?

690
01:20:28,518 --> 01:20:30,018
Hey!

691
01:20:30,386 --> 01:20:34,787
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler.

692
01:20:34,887 --> 01:20:39,488
You’ve got a lot of guts coming here,
after what you pulled.

693
01:20:49,939 --> 01:20:53,730
How you doin’, you old pirate?
So good to see you!

694
01:20:54,309 --> 01:20:56,378
Well, he seems very friendly.

695
01:20:56,479 --> 01:20:58,979
Yes.
Very friendly.

696
01:20:59,681 --> 01:21:03,386
– What are you doing here?
– Ah, repairs. I thought you could help me out.

697
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,945
<i>– What have you done to my ship?
– Your ship?</i>

698
01:21:06,046 --> 01:21:10,292
Hey, remember you lost her to me
fair and square.

699
01:21:10,393 --> 01:21:12,695
And how you doin’, Chewbacca?

700
01:21:12,796 --> 01:21:15,195
You still hanging around with this loser?

701
01:21:17,667 --> 01:21:19,667
Hello.
What have we here?

702
01:21:20,802 --> 01:21:24,707
Welcome, I’m Lando Calrissian.
I’m the administrator of this facility.

703
01:21:24,806 --> 01:21:28,010
– And who might you be?
– Leia.

704
01:21:28,109 --> 01:21:30,409
Welcome, Leia.

705
01:21:32,414 --> 01:21:35,500
All right, all right, you old smoothie.

706
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,899
Hello, sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

707
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
My facilities are at your...
Well, really!

708
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:44,750
<i>– What’s wrong with the Falcon?
– Hyperdrive.</i>

709
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,850
– I’ll get my people to work on it.
– Good.

710
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:52,550
You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times.
She’s the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

711
01:21:52,769 --> 01:21:55,505
How’s the gas mine?
It still paying off for you?

712
01:21:55,604 --> 01:21:59,341
Oh, not as well as I’d like. We’re a small
outpost and not very self-sufficient.

713
01:21:59,442 --> 01:22:04,550
And I’ve had supply problems of every kind,
I’ve had labor difficulties, I’ve had...

714
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,248
What’s so funny?

715
01:22:06,349 --> 01:22:09,485
You. Listen to you.
You sound like a businessman...

716
01:22:09,586 --> 01:22:12,899
...a responsible leader.
Who’d have thought that, huh?

717
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,359
You know, seeing you brings back
a few things.

718
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:19,524
– Yeah.
– Yeah, I’m responsible these days.

719
01:22:20,494 --> 01:22:23,631
It’s the price you pay for being successful.

720
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:27,891
Oh. Nice to see a familiar face.

721
01:22:28,671 --> 01:22:30,270
How rude!

722
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,149
That sounds like an R2 unit in there.

723
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:37,899
I wonder if...
Hello? Hello?

724
01:22:38,014 --> 01:22:40,416
– How interesting.
– Who are you?

725
01:22:40,515 --> 01:22:43,742
Oh, my! I... I’m terribly sorry.
I didn’t mean to intrude.

726
01:22:43,943 --> 01:22:45,842
N-N-No, please don’t get up.

727
01:23:03,472 --> 01:23:06,701
Luke, you must complete the training.

728
01:23:06,975 --> 01:23:10,000
I can’t keep the vision out of my head.
They’re my friends. I’ve got to help them.

729
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:14,250
– You must not go.
– But Han and Leia will die if I don’t.

730
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,550
<i>You don’t know that.</i>

731
01:23:18,087 --> 01:23:20,688
<i>Even Yoda cannot see their fate.</i>

732
01:23:21,155 --> 01:23:23,750
But I can help them.
I feel the Force.

733
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:25,828
<i>But you cannot control it.</i>

734
01:23:25,927 --> 01:23:28,363
<i>This is a dangerous time for you...</i>

735
01:23:28,463 --> 01:23:31,935
<i>...when you will be tempted
by the dark side of the Force.</i>

736
01:23:32,034 --> 01:23:35,500
Yes! Yes!
To Obi-Wan you listen.

737
01:23:35,671 --> 01:23:39,364
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave.

738
01:23:39,699 --> 01:23:43,301
But I’ve learned so much since then.
Master Yoda, I promise to return...

739
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,947
...and finish what I’ve begun.
You have my word.

740
01:23:46,716 --> 01:23:49,685
<i>It is you and your abilities
the Emperor wants.</i>

741
01:23:49,786 --> 01:23:52,685
<i>That is why your friends
are made to suffer.</i>

742
01:23:53,655 --> 01:23:55,855
That’s why I have to go.

743
01:23:55,992 --> 01:24:00,492
<i>Luke, I don’t want to lose you
to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.</i>

744
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:03,064
You won’t.

745
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:07,300
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.

746
01:24:07,537 --> 01:24:09,771
Only a fully-trained Jedi knight...

747
01:24:09,872 --> 01:24:14,300
...with the Force as his ally, will conquer
Vader and his Emperor.

748
01:24:14,476 --> 01:24:20,800
If you end your training now... if you choose
the quick and easy path, as Vader did...

749
01:24:20,899 --> 01:24:24,998
<i>– ...you will become an agent of evil.
– Patience.</i>

750
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,956
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

751
01:24:27,055 --> 01:24:31,226
If you honor what they fight for... yes.

752
01:24:31,327 --> 01:24:34,430
<i>If you choose to face Vader,
you will do it alone.</i>

753
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:36,729
<i>I cannot interfere.</i>

754
01:24:38,533 --> 01:24:40,533
I understand.

755
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:46,539
R2.

756
01:24:46,899 --> 01:24:49,199
Fire up the converters.

757
01:24:51,346 --> 01:24:55,585
<i>Luke!
Don’t give in to hate.</i>

758
01:24:55,685 --> 01:24:58,387
<i>That leads to the dark side.</i>

759
01:24:58,488 --> 01:25:03,087
Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.

760
01:25:03,524 --> 01:25:08,261
I will. And I’ll return.
I promise.

761
01:25:14,703 --> 01:25:17,750
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.

762
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:21,199
Now...
matters are worse.

763
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:26,939
<i>– That boy is our last hope.
– No, there is another.</i>

764
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,949
The ship’s almost finished. Two or three
more things and we’re in great shape.

765
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:06,250
The sooner the better. Something’s wrong here.
No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.

766
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:08,817
He’s been gone too long to have gotten lost.

767
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:13,421
Relax. I’ll talk to Lando
and see what I can find out.

768
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:18,199
– I don’t trust Lando.
– Well, I don’t trust him either.

769
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:23,363
He is my friend.
Besides, we’ll soon be gone.

770
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,764
Then you’re as good as gone, aren’t you?

771
01:27:00,701 --> 01:27:02,900
What happened?

772
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,399
Where?

773
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:08,199
Found him in a junk pile?

774
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:11,850
Oh, what a mess.
Chewie, you think you can repair him?

775
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:17,273
– Lando’s got people that can fix him.
– No thanks.

776
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:23,078
– I’m sorry, am I interrupting anything?
– Not really.

777
01:27:25,899 --> 01:27:28,195
You look absolutely beautiful.

778
01:27:28,296 --> 01:27:31,699
You truly belong here
with us among the clouds.

779
01:27:31,832 --> 01:27:35,800
– Thank you.
– Would you join me for a little refreshment?

780
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:38,262
Everyone’s invited, of course.

781
01:27:39,474 --> 01:27:44,201
– Having trouble with your droid?
– No, no problem. Why?

782
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:55,699
So you see, since we’re a small operation,
we don’t fall into...

783
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,550
...the jurisdiction of the Empire.

784
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:01,050
– So you’re part of the Mining Guild, then?
– No, not actually.

785
01:28:01,149 --> 01:28:03,470
Our operation is small enough
not to be noticed.

786
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:07,600
Which is advantageous for everybody, since
our customers are anxious to avoid...

787
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,000
...attracting attention to themselves.

788
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:14,250
Aren’t you afraid the Empire’s going to find out
about this little operation... shut you down?

789
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:17,412
It’s always been a danger, but it looms
like a shadow over everything we’ve built here.

790
01:28:17,511 --> 01:28:19,980
But things have developed
that’ll ensure security.

791
01:28:20,081 --> 01:28:24,180
I’ve just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

792
01:28:33,627 --> 01:28:37,161
We would be honored if you would join us.

793
01:28:43,302 --> 01:28:46,103
I had no choice. They arrived
right before you did.

794
01:28:46,407 --> 01:28:48,207
I’m sorry.

795
01:28:51,813 --> 01:28:53,873
I’m sorry, too.

796
01:29:07,962 --> 01:29:09,962
No, 3PO’s with them.

797
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,899
Just hang on.
We’re almost there.

798
01:30:12,559 --> 01:30:14,761
I’m terribly sorry.
I didn’t mean to intrude.

799
01:30:14,862 --> 01:30:17,296
N-N-No, please don’t get up.

800
01:30:20,702 --> 01:30:22,502
No!

801
01:30:22,603 --> 01:30:25,903
Stormtroopers? Here?
We’re in danger!

802
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,149
I must tell the others.
Oh, no, I’ve been shot!

803
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,271
Lord Vader.

804
01:30:58,372 --> 01:31:02,899
You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt
after I have Skywalker.

805
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,250
He’s no good to me dead.

806
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:08,350
He will not be permanently damaged.

807
01:31:10,551 --> 01:31:13,354
Lord Vader, what about Leia
and the Wookiee?

808
01:31:13,454 --> 01:31:16,199
They must never again leave this city.

809
01:31:16,323 --> 01:31:19,461
That was never a condition of our agreement,
nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!

810
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,060
Perhaps you think you’re
being treated unfairly?

811
01:31:26,132 --> 01:31:28,699
– No.
– Good. It would be unfortunate...

812
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,764
...if I had to leave a garrison here.

813
01:31:33,139 --> 01:31:36,207
This deal is getting worse all the time.

814
01:31:37,011 --> 01:31:39,014
Oh, yes, that’s very good.
I like that.

815
01:31:39,113 --> 01:31:40,613
Oh!

816
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,284
Something’s not right,
because now I can’t see.

817
01:31:44,385 --> 01:31:48,288
Oh, oh, oh,
that’s much better.

818
01:31:48,389 --> 01:31:52,024
Wait! Wait! Oh, my!
What have you done?

819
01:31:52,292 --> 01:31:55,496
I’m backwards!
You flea-bitten furball!

820
01:31:55,595 --> 01:31:59,195
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough—

821
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:15,180
I feel terrible.

822
01:32:30,197 --> 01:32:32,396
Why are they doing this?

823
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,500
They never even asked me any questions.

824
01:32:42,309 --> 01:32:43,900
Lando.

825
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,899
– Get out of here, Lando.
– Shut up and listen! Vader’s agreed...

826
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,300
– ...to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
– Over to you...

827
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:54,189
They’ll have to stay here,
but at least they’ll be safe.

828
01:32:54,288 --> 01:32:57,000
– What about Han?
– Vader’s giving him to the bounty hunter.

829
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,300
– Vader wants us all dead.
– He doesn’t want you at all.

830
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:01,800
He’s after somebody called, uh, Skywalker.

831
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:04,500
– Luke.
– Lord Vader set a trap for him.

832
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,832
– And we’re the bait!
– Yeah, well, he’s on his way.

833
01:33:06,932 --> 01:33:10,671
Perfect... you fixed us all
real good, didn’t you?

834
01:33:10,771 --> 01:33:12,771
My friend.

835
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,034
Stop!

836
01:33:17,845 --> 01:33:19,679
I’ve done all I can.

837
01:33:19,779 --> 01:33:22,300
I’m sorry I couldn’t do better,
but I’ve got my own problems.

838
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:25,500
Yeah.
You’re a real hero.

839
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:39,157
You certainly have a way with people.

840
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,149
This facility is crude...

841
01:33:55,248 --> 01:34:00,349
...but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker
for his journey to the Emperor.

842
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,423
Lord Vader, ship approaching,
X-wing class.

843
01:34:03,524 --> 01:34:07,524
Good. Monitor Skywalker
and allow him to land.

844
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,550
Lord Vader, we only use this facility
for carbon freezing.

845
01:34:11,649 --> 01:34:16,337
– You put him in there, it might kill him.
– I do not want the Emperor’s prize damaged.

846
01:34:16,438 --> 01:34:20,128
We will test it...
on Captain Solo.

847
01:34:43,296 --> 01:34:47,533
If only you’d attached my legs,
I wouldn’t be in this ridiculous position.

848
01:34:47,634 --> 01:34:50,637
Now remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility for me...

849
01:34:50,738 --> 01:34:53,002
...so don’t do anything foolish.

850
01:35:05,953 --> 01:35:08,800
What’s going on...
buddy?

851
01:35:09,023 --> 01:35:11,458
You’re being put into carbon freeze.

852
01:35:11,559 --> 01:35:15,029
What if he doesn’t survive?
He’s worth a lot to me.

853
01:35:15,128 --> 01:35:19,128
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies. Put him in.

854
01:35:24,171 --> 01:35:26,104
Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!

855
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,149
Yes, stop, please!
I’m not ready to die!

856
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,845
Hey! Hey! Listen to me, Chewie.

857
01:35:31,945 --> 01:35:35,199
Chewie, this won’t help me.
Hey, save your strength.

858
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,399
There’ll be another time.

859
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:42,518
The princess... you have to
take care of her.

860
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,199
Do you hear me? Huh?

861
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,774
I love you.

862
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:03,604
I know.

863
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:36,199
What’s going on? Turn around!
Chewbacca, I can’t see.

864
01:37:34,134 --> 01:37:36,800
Oh, they’ve encased him in carbonite.

865
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:40,541
He should be quite well-protected,
if he survived the freezing process, that is.

866
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,140
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

867
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:48,199
Yes, he’s alive.
And in perfect hibernation.

868
01:37:48,582 --> 01:37:51,381
He’s all yours, bounty hunter.

869
01:37:51,551 --> 01:37:54,176
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

870
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,091
Skywalker has just landed, lord.

871
01:37:58,192 --> 01:38:02,192
Good. See to it
that he finds his way in here.

872
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:10,171
Calrissian, take the princess
and the Wookiee to my ship.

873
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:12,640
You said they’d be left in the city
under my supervision.

874
01:38:12,739 --> 01:38:17,239
I am altering the deal.
Pray I don’t alter it any further.

875
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,168
Luke! Luke, don’t,
it’s a trap!

876
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:00,899
It’s a trap!

877
01:40:46,192 --> 01:40:49,552
The Force is with you, young Skywalker.

878
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:54,023
But you are not a Jedi yet.

879
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,328
Well done.

880
01:41:58,664 --> 01:42:02,965
Hold them in the security tower.
And keep it quiet. Move.

881
01:42:08,274 --> 01:42:11,100
– What do you think you’re doing?
– We’re getting out of here.

882
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,149
I knew all along.
It had to be a mistake.

883
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:16,298
Do you think that after what you did
to Han, that we’re going to trust you?

884
01:42:16,899 --> 01:42:18,350
I had no choice.

885
01:42:18,449 --> 01:42:20,449
What are you doing?
Trust him! Trust him!

886
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:23,457
We understand, don’t we, Chewie?
He had no choice.

887
01:42:23,556 --> 01:42:27,899
– I’m just trying to help.
– We don’t need any of your help.

888
01:42:28,028 --> 01:42:29,728
Haaa...

889
01:42:31,163 --> 01:42:32,899
Ha... Ha...

890
01:42:32,998 --> 01:42:34,600
– What?
– Han...

891
01:42:34,699 --> 01:42:39,699
– It sounds like Han.
– There’s still a chance to save Han...

892
01:42:39,805 --> 01:42:42,006
...at the east...

893
01:42:42,141 --> 01:42:44,010
...platform.

894
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:45,710
Chewie.

895
01:42:47,546 --> 01:42:51,346
I’m terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he’s only a Wookiee.

896
01:42:52,051 --> 01:42:55,051
Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

897
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:12,470
R2, R2, where have you been?

898
01:43:13,073 --> 01:43:15,073
Wait. Turn around, you woolly...

899
01:43:15,742 --> 01:43:18,899
Hurry! Hurry! We’re trying to save Han
from the bounty hunter.

900
01:43:21,301 --> 01:43:23,750
Well, at least you’re still in one piece.

901
01:43:23,850 --> 01:43:26,050
Look what happened to me!

902
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:40,800
Oh, no! Chewie, they’re behind you!

903
01:43:53,747 --> 01:43:56,100
You have learned much, young one.

904
01:43:56,199 --> 01:43:58,600
You’ll find I’m full of surprises.

905
01:44:09,695 --> 01:44:12,895
Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.

906
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,199
Obi-Wan knew this to be true.

907
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,067
No.

908
01:44:24,444 --> 01:44:26,543
All too easy.

909
01:44:30,784 --> 01:44:33,984
Perhaps you’re not as strong
as the Emperor thought.

910
01:44:36,856 --> 01:44:39,051
Impressive.

911
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:42,261
Most impressive.

912
01:44:49,069 --> 01:44:51,337
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

913
01:44:51,438 --> 01:44:54,337
You have controlled your fear.

914
01:44:55,809 --> 01:44:59,109
Now...
release your anger.

915
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:02,600
Only your hatred can destroy me.

916
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:14,957
Argh!

917
01:47:12,752 --> 01:47:16,600
– The security code has been changed.
– R2, you can tell the computer...

918
01:47:16,699 --> 01:47:18,800
...to override the security systems.

919
01:47:19,091 --> 01:47:21,192
R2, hurry!

920
01:47:23,561 --> 01:47:27,250
Attention. This is Lando Calrissian.
The Empire has taken control of the city.

921
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:31,149
I advise everyone to leave
before more Imperial troops arrive.

922
01:47:37,239 --> 01:47:40,600
– This way.
– Well, don’t blame me. I’m an interpreter.

923
01:47:40,699 --> 01:47:43,800
I’m not supposed to know a power socket
from a computer terminal.

924
01:48:04,699 --> 01:48:09,500
<i>Ah! We’re not interested in the hyperdrive on
the Millennium Falcon. It’s fixed!</i>

925
01:48:12,742 --> 01:48:15,574
Just open the door, you stupid lump!

926
01:48:24,487 --> 01:48:27,686
I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!

927
01:48:49,947 --> 01:48:51,899
Ouch! Oh! Ouch that hurts!

928
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,500
Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!

929
01:48:59,622 --> 01:49:01,399
Leia!

930
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,199
Go!

931
01:49:08,997 --> 01:49:11,497
I thought that hairy beast
would be the end of me.

932
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:14,869
Of course I’ve looked better!

933
01:50:08,091 --> 01:50:11,694
You are beaten.
It is useless to resist.

934
01:50:11,795 --> 01:50:14,795
Don’t let yourself be destroyed,
as Obi-Wan did.

935
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,048
There is no escape.

936
01:50:33,149 --> 01:50:36,048
Don’t make me destroy you.

937
01:50:37,787 --> 01:50:42,100
Luke... you do not yet realize
your importance.

938
01:50:42,199 --> 01:50:45,050
You have only begun to discover your power.

939
01:50:45,149 --> 01:50:49,250
Join me, and I will complete your training.

940
01:50:49,466 --> 01:50:51,899
With our combined strength...

941
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,899
...we can end this destructive conflict...

942
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,399
...and bring order to the galaxy.

943
01:50:57,649 --> 01:50:59,475
I’ll never join you!

944
01:50:59,576 --> 01:51:04,076
If you only knew the power
of the dark side.

945
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:08,649
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

946
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:10,980
He told me enough.

947
01:51:12,956 --> 01:51:15,456
– He told me you killed him.
– No.

948
01:51:16,126 --> 01:51:18,926
I am your father.

949
01:51:23,033 --> 01:51:25,733
No... no...

950
01:51:26,903 --> 01:51:28,903
That’s not true.

951
01:51:29,899 --> 01:51:31,475
That’s impossible!

952
01:51:31,574 --> 01:51:35,074
Search your feelings.
You know it to be true.

953
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:38,399
No!

954
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:41,100
No!

955
01:51:42,519 --> 01:51:45,918
Luke. You can destroy the Emperor.

956
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:50,149
He has foreseen this.
It is your destiny.

957
01:51:50,899 --> 01:51:55,250
Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy...

958
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:57,750
...as father and son.

959
01:52:08,078 --> 01:52:09,945
Come with me.

960
01:52:10,046 --> 01:52:12,445
It is the only way.

961
01:53:18,582 --> 01:53:20,381
Ben.

962
01:53:20,817 --> 01:53:22,917
Ben, please.

963
01:53:32,199 --> 01:53:33,800
Ben.

964
01:53:38,801 --> 01:53:40,402
Leia.

965
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:52,671
Hear me.

966
01:53:53,783 --> 01:53:55,324
Leia.

967
01:53:55,425 --> 01:53:57,125
Luke.

968
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,100
– We’ve got to go back.
– What?

969
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:03,850
– I know where Luke is.
– Well, what about those fighters?

970
01:54:04,659 --> 01:54:06,960
– Chewie, just do it.
– But what about Vader?

971
01:54:07,161 --> 01:54:09,796
All right, all right, all right!

972
01:54:16,706 --> 01:54:18,805
Bring my shuttle.

973
01:54:32,350 --> 01:54:34,751
Look, someone’s up there.

974
01:54:36,088 --> 01:54:38,199
It’s Luke.
Chewie, slow down.

975
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:42,100
Slow down, and we’ll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

976
01:54:58,472 --> 01:55:00,872
Okay. Easy, Chewie.

977
01:55:22,797 --> 01:55:25,358
<i>– Lando?
– Okay, let’s go.</i>

978
01:55:42,184 --> 01:55:44,485
Oh, Leia.

979
01:55:44,586 --> 01:55:46,586
All right, Chewie, let’s go.

980
01:56:20,935 --> 01:56:22,836
I’ll be back.

981
01:56:28,644 --> 01:56:30,777
Star Destroyer.

982
01:56:35,184 --> 01:56:37,684
All right, Chewie.
Ready for light speed.

983
01:56:38,052 --> 01:56:42,390
If your people fixed the hyperdrive...
All the coordinates are set. It’s now or never.

984
01:56:42,490 --> 01:56:44,091
Punch it!

985
01:56:54,636 --> 01:56:56,600
They told me they fixed it.

986
01:56:56,699 --> 01:57:00,500
I trusted them to fix it!
It’s not my fault!

987
01:57:07,015 --> 01:57:09,649
They’ll be in range
of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

988
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:13,149
<i>Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon?</i>

989
01:57:13,689 --> 01:57:15,500
– Yes, my lord.
– Good.

990
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:19,750
Prepare the boarding party,
and set your weapons for stun.

991
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:22,350
– Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.
– Yes, sir.

992
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:27,048
Noisy brute. Why don’t we just
go into light speed?

993
01:57:27,449 --> 01:57:29,037
We can’t?

994
01:57:29,136 --> 01:57:31,837
How would you know the hyperdrive
is deactivated?

995
01:57:34,837 --> 01:57:37,100
The city’s central computer told you?

996
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:40,801
R2-D2, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.

997
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,779
Ouch! Pay attention to what you’re doing!

998
01:57:55,162 --> 01:57:58,363
– Luke.
– Father.

999
01:57:59,266 --> 01:58:02,567
Son, come with me.

1000
01:58:04,338 --> 01:58:06,139
Ben.

1001
01:58:06,742 --> 01:58:09,733
Why didn’t you tell me?

1002
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,100
Chewie!

1003
01:58:27,429 --> 01:58:29,326
It’s Vader.

1004
01:58:34,399 --> 01:58:38,000
Luke, it is your destiny.

1005
01:58:42,711 --> 01:58:44,411
Ben.

1006
01:58:45,579 --> 01:58:48,247
Why didn’t you tell me?

1007
01:58:54,155 --> 01:58:56,256
Alert all commands.

1008
01:58:56,490 --> 01:58:58,690
Ready for the tractor beam.

1009
01:59:01,261 --> 01:59:04,533
R2, come back at once!
You haven’t finished with me yet.

1010
01:59:04,632 --> 01:59:07,899
You don’t know how to fix
the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.

1011
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,500
I’m standing here in pieces, and you’re
having delusions of grandeur!

1012
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:17,938
You did it!

1013
02:00:14,601 --> 02:00:18,402
<i>– Luke, we’re ready for takeoff.
– Good luck, Lando.</i>

1014
02:00:18,838 --> 02:00:22,699
<i>When we find Jabba the Hutt
and that bounty hunter, we’ll contact you.</i>

1015
02:00:23,144 --> 02:00:25,644
I’ll meet you at the rendezvous point
on Tatooine.

1016
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:29,199
Princess, we’ll find Han.
I promise.

1017
02:00:29,451 --> 02:00:33,451
Chewie, I’ll be waiting for your signal.
Take care, you two.

1018
02:00:33,921 --> 02:00:36,221
<i>May the Force be with you.</i>

1019
02:00:48,703 --> 02:00:50,302
Ow!
