1
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:32,946
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:36,074
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,910
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated

4
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,621
when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:42,705
Stand by.

6
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,959
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,502
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:18,533
Inform the commander
that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,993
Sir.

10
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,281
Lord Vader,
this is an unexpected pleasure.

11
00:03:58,364 --> 00:03:59,532
We're honoured by your presence.

12
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,076
You may dispense
with the pleasantries, Commander.

13
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,621
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

14
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:07,874
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

15
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:11,377
Perhaps I can find new ways
to motivate them.

16
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,715
I tell you this station
will be operational, as planned.

17
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:21,596
The Emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

18
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:25,183
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

19
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,353
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

20
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,022
The Emperor's coming here?

21
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:33,107
That is correct, Commander,

22
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:38,029
and he is most displeased
with your apparent lack of progress.

23
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:40,615
We shall double our efforts.

24
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,993
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

25
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:47,997
The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

26
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,184
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be, too.

27
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:12,397
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

28
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,526
Don't be so sure.

29
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,321
If I told you half the things
I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt,

30
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,656
you'd probably short-circuit.

31
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,714
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

32
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,261
I'd better knock, I suppose.

33
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,016
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

34
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:54,939
Goodness gracious me!

35
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,382
I don't think
they're going to let us in, R2.

36
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:24,719
We'd better go.

37
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,896
R2, wait!

38
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,025
Oh, dear! R2!

39
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,653
R2, I really don't
think we should rush into all this.

40
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,782
R2!

41
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:47,450
R2, wait for me!

42
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:59,045
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here. Oh, my!

43
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,635
Oh, no.

44
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:11,766
Oh, my!

45
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,440
We bring a message
to your master Jabba the Hutt.

46
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,530
And a gift.

47
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,073
Gift? What gift?

48
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:48,761
He says that our instructions
are to give it only to Jabba himself.

49
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,147
I'm terribly sorry.

50
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:03,234
I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn
about these sort of things.

51
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,072
R2, I have
a bad feeling about this.

52
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,483
Good morning.

53
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,450
The message, R2, the message.

54
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:04,045
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

55
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,505
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

56
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,551
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

57
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,804
<i>I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba,</i>

58
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,558
<i>and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.</i>

59
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,894
<i>I seek an audience
with Your Greatness</i>

60
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,604
<i>to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

61
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,402
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure
that we can work out an arrangement</i>

62
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,987
<i>which will be mutually beneficial</i>

63
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:34,700
<i>and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

64
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,954
<i>As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift,</i>

65
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:39,997
<i>these two droids.</i>

66
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,874
What did he say?

67
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,169
<i>Both are hard-working
and will serve you well.</i>

68
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,088
This can't be!

69
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,465
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

70
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,099
He's no Jedi.

71
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,732
We're doomed.

72
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,456
R2, look, Captain Solo.

73
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,251
And he's still frozen in carbonite.

74
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,599
What could possibly
have come over Master Luke?

75
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,852
Was it something I did?

76
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,771
He never expressed any unhappiness
with my work.

77
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,565
Oh. Oh. How horrid!

78
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:19,430
Good. New acquisitions.

79
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:22,475
You are a protocol droid, are you not?

80
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,351
I am C-3PO...

81
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,854
Yes or no will do.

82
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:27,980
Well, yes.

83
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:30,608
How many languages do you speak?

84
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:35,321
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can...

85
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,323
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter

86
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:42,161
since our master got angry with our last
protocol droid and disintegrated him.

87
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,080
Disintegrated?

88
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,922
Guard!
This protocol droid might be useful.

89
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:55,216
Fit him with a restraining bolt

90
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,677
and take him back up to His
Excellency's main audience chamber.

91
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:02,139
R2, don't leave me!

92
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,395
You're a feisty little one,

93
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,731
but you'll soon learn some respect.

94
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:14,610
I have need for you
on the master's sail barge,

95
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,238
and I think you'll fill in nicely.

96
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,200
No! No! No!

97
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,265
No. Chewbacca!

98
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,949
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

99
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,242
Yes?

100
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,545
The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome

101
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,046
and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

102
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,887
50,000. No less.

103
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,152
What... What did I say?

104
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:52,119
The mighty Jabba
asks why he must pay 50,000.

105
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,459
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator!

106
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,240
Jabba offers the sum of 35

107
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,493
and I do suggest you take it.

108
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,958
He agrees!

109
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,964
Just relax for a moment.

110
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,883
You're free of the carbonite.

111
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,430
You have hibernation sickness.

112
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:41,723
I can't see.

113
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,143
Your eyesight will return in time.

114
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,728
Where am I?

115
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,480
Jabba's palace.

116
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,651
Who are you?

117
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,700
Someone who loves you.

118
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,076
Leia.

119
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,665
I got to get you out of here.

120
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,252
What's that?

121
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,298
I know that laugh.

122
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,597
Hey, Jabba...

123
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,182
Look, Jabba,

124
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,477
I was just on my way to pay you back,
and I got a little sidetracked.

125
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,603
It's not my fault.

126
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,414
Look...

127
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,668
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

128
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,589
You're throwing away a fortune!
Don't be a fool!

129
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:05,891
We have powerful friends.

130
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,059
You're going to regret this.

131
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,778
I can't bear to watch.

132
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,044
Chewie?

133
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,297
Chewie, is that you?

134
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,382
Chewie!

135
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,177
I can't see, pal.

136
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,805
What's going on?

137
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,309
Luke? Luke's crazy.

138
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,813
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

139
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,400
A Jedi knight?

140
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:01,112
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

141
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,827
I'm all right, pal.

142
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,871
I'm all right.

143
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,177
I must speak with Jabba.

144
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,226
No bargain.

145
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,770
You will take me to Jabba now.

146
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,152
You serve your master well.

147
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,864
And you will be rewarded.

148
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,126
At last!
Master Luke's come to rescue me.

149
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,210
Master.

150
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,222
I must be allowed to speak.

151
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:07,781
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

152
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,047
Nevertheless,
I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends.

153
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:28,259
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

154
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,388
It's your choice, but I warn you
not to underestimate my powers.

155
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,725
Master Luke, you're standing on...

156
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,309
Oh, no! The rancour!

157
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:30,376
Han!

158
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,086
Luke!

159
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,547
Are you all right?

160
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,549
Fine. Together again, huh?

161
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,092
Wouldn't miss it.

162
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,260
How are we doing?

163
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:40,345
Same as always.

164
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,804
That bad, huh?

165
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,598
Where's Leia?

166
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,807
I'm here.

167
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,313
Oh, dear.

168
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,858
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt,

169
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:57,236
has decreed that you are to
be terminated immediately.

170
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,821
Good. I hate long waits.

171
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,826
You will therefore
be taken to the Dune Sea

172
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,287
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon,

173
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,498
the nesting place
of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

174
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,083
Doesn't sound so bad.

175
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:14,003
In his belly, you will find
a new definition of pain and suffering,

176
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,215
as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

177
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,177
On second thought,
let's pass on that, huh?

178
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,595
You should have bargained.

179
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,893
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

180
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,238
I think my eyes are getting better.

181
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,366
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

182
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:27,785
There's nothing to see.

183
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,287
I used to live here, you know.

184
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,247
You're going to die here, you know.

185
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,415
Convenient.

186
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,792
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

187
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:37,003
I've taken care of everything.

188
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,171
Oh.

189
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,505
Great.

190
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,091
Ow.

191
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,227
I'm terribly sorry.

192
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:56,272
R2, what are you doing here?

193
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,233
Well, I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

194
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:02,278
They're going to execute Master Luke
and, if we're not careful, us, too.

195
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,241
I wish I had your confidence.

196
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,101
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc,

197
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:36,062
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

198
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,441
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy,

199
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:44,070
the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

200
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:54,205
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth

201
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:57,792
he'll get no such pleasure from us!
Right?

202
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,004
Jabba,

203
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,965
this is your last chance.

204
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,467
Free us or die.

205
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,068
Easy, Chewie.

206
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,455
Help!

207
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,380
Chewie, you're hit? Where is it?

208
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,971
Han! Chewie!

209
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,139
Lando!

210
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,565
Boba Fett?

211
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,110
Boba Fett? Where?

212
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:23,688
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

213
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:24,772
I'm trying!

214
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,588
- Grab me, Chewie. Come on, grab it.
- I'm slipping! Quick!

215
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:04,270
Grab it! Almost...
You almost got it.

216
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:14,989
Gently, now.

217
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,033
All right. Easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.

218
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,537
Chewie!

219
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,463
Chewie, give me the gun.

220
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:31,756
Don't move, Lando.

221
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,591
Wait! I thought you were blind!

222
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,760
It's all right! I can see a lot better!
Don't move!

223
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,344
A little higher! Just a little higher!

224
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,308
Chewie, pull us up.

225
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,269
Up, Chewie. Up.

226
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,273
Come on. We gotta get out of here.

227
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,192
Not my eyes! R2, help!

228
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,778
Quickly, R2!

229
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,530
Beast!

230
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:02,870
Get the gun!

231
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:04,413
Point it at the deck!

232
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,462
Point it at the deck!

233
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:18,552
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly go...

234
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,475
Come on!

235
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:34,110
Let's go. And don't forget the droids.

236
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,361
We're on our way.

237
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,193
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

238
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:17,319
<i>Hurry.</i>

239
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,071
<i>The Alliance should be assembled by now.</i>

240
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,156
I will.

241
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,949
<i>Hey, Luke, thanks.</i>

242
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,534
<i>Thanks for coming after me.</i>

243
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,244
<i>Now I owe you one.</i>

244
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,377
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

245
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:42,011
I have a promise to keep,

246
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,971
to an old friend.

247
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,690
Rise, my friend.

248
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,659
The Death Star will be completed
on schedule.

249
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:49,787
You've done well, Lord Vader.

250
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:55,709
And now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

251
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,797
Yes, my master.

252
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,216
Patience, my friend.

253
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:06,470
In time, he will seek you out.

254
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:10,349
And when he does,
you must bring him before me.

255
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,435
He has grown strong.

256
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:19,400
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

257
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,360
As you wish.

258
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:26,657
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

259
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,935
That face you make...

260
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,564
Look I so old to young eyes?

261
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,733
No, of course not.

262
00:40:02,026 --> 00:40:03,277
I do.

263
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,490
Yes, I do.

264
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,703
Sick have I become.

265
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,331
Old and weak.

266
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,256
When 900 years old you reach,
look as good you will not?

267
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,931
Soon will I rest.

268
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,641
Yes.

269
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,143
Forever sleep.

270
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,730
Earned it I have.

271
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,524
Master Yoda, you can't die.

272
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:47,905
Strong am I with the Force,
but not that strong.

273
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:56,205
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

274
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,378
That is the way of things...

275
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,715
The way of the Force.

276
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,469
But I need your help.

277
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,555
I've come back to complete the training.

278
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:15,891
No more training do you require.

279
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,019
Already know you that which you need.

280
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,608
Then I am a Jedi.

281
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:32,658
Not yet.

282
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:34,701
One thing remains...

283
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,704
Vader.

284
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:41,333
You must confront Vader.

285
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:45,087
Then, only then, a Jedi will you be.

286
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:49,758
And confront him you will.

287
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,931
Master Yoda,

288
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,520
is Darth Vader my father?

289
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,567
Rest I need.

290
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:08,819
Yes.

291
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,362
Rest.

292
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:14,116
Yoda, I must know.

293
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,372
Your father he is.

294
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,214
Told you, did he?

295
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,177
Yes.

296
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,597
Unexpected this is.

297
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,726
And unfortunate.

298
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,563
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

299
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,064
No.

300
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:52,321
Unfortunate that you rushed to face him,

301
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,532
that incomplete was your training,

302
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,287
that not ready for the burden were you.

303
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:03,457
I'm sorry.

304
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,543
Remember,

305
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:10,339
a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.

306
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,471
But beware...

307
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,474
Anger, fear, aggression,

308
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,310
the dark side are they.

309
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:27,356
Once you start down the dark path,

310
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:31,485
forever will it dominate your destiny.

311
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,532
Luke...

312
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:38,951
Luke,

313
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,078
do not...

314
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:48,877
Do not underestimate
the powers of the Emperor,

315
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:52,923
or suffer your father's fate you will.

316
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,553
Luke,

317
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:59,388
when gone am I,

318
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:03,642
the last of the Jedi will you be.

319
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,144
Luke,

320
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:12,150
the Force runs strong in your family.

321
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:18,490
Pass on what you have learned.

322
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,536
Luke...

323
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:29,751
there is...

324
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,255
another...

325
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:36,842
Sk...

326
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,179
Sky... walker.

327
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:44,117
I can't do it, R2.

328
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:50,374
I can't go on alone.

329
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:53,627
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

330
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,128
Obi-Wan.

331
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,263
Why didn't you tell me?

332
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:08,809
You told me Vader
betrayed and murdered my father.

333
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:13,980
Your father was seduced by
the dark side of the Force.

334
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:18,985
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

335
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:23,323
When that happened, the good man
who was your father was destroyed.

336
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,910
So what I told you was true,

337
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,787
from a certain point of view.

338
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:31,415
A certain point of view?

339
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,210
Luke, you're going to find that
many of the truths we cling to

340
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,463
depend greatly on our own point of view.

341
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,134
Anakin was a good friend.

342
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:46,638
When I first knew him,
your father was already a great pilot,

343
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:50,016
but I was amazed
how strongly the Force was with him.

344
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:53,687
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

345
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:58,817
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

346
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,235
I was wrong.

347
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,946
There is still good in him.

348
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,866
He's more machine now than man,

349
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,701
twisted and evil.

350
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,747
I can't do it, Ben.

351
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,957
You cannot escape your destiny.

352
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:17,335
You must face Darth Vader again.

353
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:19,963
I can't kill my own father.

354
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:27,304
Then the Emperor has already won.

355
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:30,807
You were our only hope.

356
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:33,477
Yoda spoke of another.

357
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,898
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

358
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:40,734
- But I have no sister.
- Hmm.

359
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:43,653
To protect you both from the Emperor,

360
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,491
you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

361
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,035
The Emperor knew, as I did,

362
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:53,789
if Anakin were to have any offspring,

363
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,374
they would be a threat to him.

364
00:47:56,583 --> 00:48:01,797
That is the reason why
your sister remains safely anonymous.

365
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,174
Leia!

366
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,842
Leia's my sister.

367
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:09,387
Your insight serves you well.

368
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:12,766
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

369
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:18,104
They do you credit, but they
could be made to serve the Emperor.

370
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:43,338
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

371
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,756
Someone must have told them

372
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,842
about my little manoeuvre
at the Battle of Tanaab.

373
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:49,970
Well, don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

374
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:52,931
I didn't know they were looking
for somebody to lead this crazy attack.

375
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,767
I'm surprised
they didn't ask you to do it.

376
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,978
Who says they didn't? But I ain't crazy.

377
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,647
You're the respectable one, remember?

378
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:11,241
The Emperor's made a critical error,
and the time for our attack has come.

379
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,119
The data brought to us
by the Bothan spies

380
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:18,081
pinpoint the exact location
of the Emperor's new battle station.

381
00:49:18,415 --> 00:49:20,959
We also know that
the weapon systems of this Death Star

382
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,460
are not yet operational.

383
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:25,380
With the Imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy,

384
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,007
in a vain effort to engage us,

385
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,050
it is relatively unprotected.

386
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:32,137
But most important of all,

387
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:35,390
we've learned that the Emperor himself
is personally overseeing

388
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,852
the final stages of the construction
of this Death Star.

389
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:43,648
Many Bothans died to
bring us this information.

390
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,611
Admiral Ackbar, please.

391
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:53,450
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

392
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:58,496
Although the weapon systems on
this Death Star are not yet operational,

393
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:02,667
the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

394
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:06,129
It is protected by an energy shield

395
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,591
which is generated from
the nearby forest moon of Endor.

396
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:19,434
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

397
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:24,731
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter

398
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:27,651
while the fighters
fly into the superstructure

399
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:30,612
and attempt to
knock out the main reactor.

400
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:37,077
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

401
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,203
Good luck.

402
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:41,748
You're going to need it.

403
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:43,833
General Madine.

404
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:47,587
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.

405
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:51,925
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret Imperial code,

406
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:56,805
a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

407
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,223
Sounds dangerous.

408
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:00,600
I wonder who they found
to pull that off.

409
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:03,561
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

410
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:05,397
My team's ready.

411
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,732
I don't have a command crew
for the shuttle.

412
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:11,027
It's going to be rough, pal.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

413
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:14,823
That's one.

414
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,450
General, count me in.

415
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:19,786
I'm with you, too.

416
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,334
What is it?

417
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:28,253
Ask me again sometime.

418
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,462
Luke.

419
00:51:29,546 --> 00:51:31,089
Hi, Han, Chewie.

420
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,427
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

421
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:54,070
Look, I want you to take her.

422
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:55,822
I mean it. Take her.

423
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,532
You need all the help you can get.

424
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,325
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

425
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:01,661
All right, old buddy.

426
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:03,913
I know what she means to you.

427
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,749
I'll take good care of her.

428
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:08,585
She won't get a scratch.

429
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:10,378
All right?

430
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:11,713
Right.

431
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,929
I got your promise.

432
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,389
Not a scratch.

433
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:23,600
Would you get going, you pirate?

434
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:26,644
Good luck.

435
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:28,354
You, too.

436
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,490
Got her warmed?

437
00:52:38,615 --> 00:52:39,908
She's coming up.

438
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:43,578
Yeah, well, I don't think
the Empire had Wookiees in mind

439
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,372
when they designed her, Chewie.

440
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:57,509
Hey, you awake?

441
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:01,721
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

442
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,308
Come on, General, let's move.

443
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:09,437
Right. Chewie, let's see
what this piece of junk can do.

444
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:10,730
Ready, everybody?

445
00:53:10,897 --> 00:53:12,357
All set.

446
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,069
Here we go again.

447
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,665
All right, hang on.

448
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,809
What is thy bidding,
my master?

449
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:52,147
Send the fleet
to the far side of Endor.

450
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:59,320
There it will stay until called for.

451
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:05,285
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

452
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:07,370
It is of no concern.

453
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:12,375
Soon the rebellion will be crushed
and young Skywalker will be one of us.

454
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,377
Your work here is finished, my friend.

455
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:17,088
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

456
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:18,506
Yes, my master.

457
00:54:34,856 --> 00:54:35,857
If they don't go for this,

458
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,026
we're gonna have to get out of here
pretty quick, Chewie.

459
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:41,613
<i>We have you on our screen now.</i>

460
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:44,073
<i>Please identify.</i>

461
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:48,161
Shuttle <i>Tydirium</i> requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

462
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:57,879
Shuttle <i>Tydirium,</i> transmit
the clearance code for shield passage.

463
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,840
Transmission commencing.

464
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:03,801
Now we find out if that code is worth
the price we paid.

465
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:06,971
It'll work. It'll work.

466
00:55:09,224 --> 00:55:10,767
Vader's on that ship.

467
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:14,437
Now, don't get jittery, Luke.
There are a lot of command ships.

468
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:17,398
Keep your distance, though, Chewie,

469
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:19,234
but don't look like you're trying
to keep your distance.

470
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:23,446
I don't know. Fly casual.

471
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,536
Where is that shuttle going?

472
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:33,748
Shuttle <i>Tydirium,</i>
what is your cargo and destination?

473
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,752
<i>Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.</i>

474
00:55:40,255 --> 00:55:42,423
Do they have a code clearance?

475
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,260
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

476
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:46,761
I was about to clear them.

477
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:54,978
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

478
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,146
It's your imagination, kid.

479
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,565
Let's keep a little optimism here.

480
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:09,701
Shall I hold them?

481
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:11,869
No.

482
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:13,538
Leave them to me.

483
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:15,790
I will deal with them myself.

484
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,210
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

485
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:23,089
They're not going for it, Chewie.

486
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,803
<i>Shuttle</i> Tydirium,

487
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:31,180
<i>deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.</i>

488
00:56:31,264 --> 00:56:32,557
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

489
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:35,810
Okay. I told you it was going to work.

490
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:37,729
No problem.

491
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:13,222
I told you it was dangerous here!

492
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,239
Should we try and go around?

493
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:31,824
It'll take time.

494
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:35,036
This whole party will be for nothing
if they see us.

495
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,416
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

496
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,127
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

497
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,296
Hey, it's me.

498
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:13,074
Go for help! Go!

499
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:15,243
Great. Come on!

500
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,677
Over there! Two more of them.

501
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,847
I see them. Wait, Leia!

502
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,144
Hey, wait!

503
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:49,986
Quick. Jam their comlink! Centre switch!

504
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:03,332
Move closer!

505
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,753
Get alongside that one!

506
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:51,005
Keep on that one! I'll take these two!

507
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:06,515
General Solo, somebody's coming.

508
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:09,727
Oh!

509
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,235
Luke!

510
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,113
Where's Leia?

511
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,032
She didn't come back?

512
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:24,367
I thought she was with you.

513
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,994
We got separated.
We better go look for her.

514
01:02:27,078 --> 01:02:28,287
Take the squad ahead.

515
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:30,122
We'll meet at the shield generator
at 0300.

516
01:02:30,206 --> 01:02:32,833
Come on, R2,
we'll need your scanners.

517
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:34,877
Don't worry, Master Luke.

518
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,337
We know what to do.

519
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:39,924
And you said it was pretty here.

520
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,864
Cut it out!

521
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,467
I'm not going to hurt you.

522
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,853
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

523
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,940
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

524
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:41,610
Maybe you can help me.

525
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,405
Come on. Sit down.

526
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:48,534
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

527
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:52,621
All right. You want something to eat?

528
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:00,796
That's right.

529
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:06,802
Come on.

530
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:29,116
Look. It's a hat.

531
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:31,452
It's not going to hurt you. Look.

532
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,211
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

533
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:47,134
What is it?

534
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:27,758
Freeze!

535
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,593
Come on, get up!

536
01:05:34,849 --> 01:05:36,392
Go get your ride. Take her back to base.

537
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:37,810
Yes, sir.

538
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,691
What the...

539
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:03,752
Come on. Let's get out of here.

540
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:48,339
I told you
to remain on the command ship.

541
01:06:49,757 --> 01:06:54,303
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

542
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,932
Yes, I know.

543
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,268
My son is with them.

544
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,688
Are you sure?

545
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:07,900
I have felt him, my master.

546
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,570
Strange that I have not.

547
01:07:13,572 --> 01:07:18,035
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

548
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:21,580
They are clear, my master.

549
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:26,001
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

550
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,671
He will come to me?

551
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,967
I have foreseen it.

552
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:37,805
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

553
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:41,934
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

554
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,144
As you wish.

555
01:07:56,156 --> 01:07:57,825
Luke! Luke!

556
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:07,292
Oh, Master Luke.

557
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:13,173
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

558
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:15,217
And I found this.

559
01:08:17,052 --> 01:08:21,265
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

560
01:08:24,018 --> 01:08:25,728
I hope she's all right.

561
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:31,650
What, Chewie?

562
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:35,529
What, Chewie?

563
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,503
I don't get it.

564
01:08:51,587 --> 01:08:53,297
It's just a dead animal, Chewie.

565
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:55,299
Chewie, wait! Don't!

566
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:02,264
Nice work.

567
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,184
Great, Chewie.

568
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:07,686
Great.
Always thinking with your stomach.

569
01:09:07,895 --> 01:09:11,106
Take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

570
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:12,900
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

571
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:14,610
Yeah. Sure.

572
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:24,203
R2, I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

573
01:09:24,286 --> 01:09:25,996
It's a very long drop!

574
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,827
What...

575
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:12,126
Hey! Point that thing someplace else.

576
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:17,673
Hey!

577
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,716
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

578
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,684
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

579
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:33,272
My head!

580
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:38,443
Oh, my goodness.

581
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:12,603
Do you understand anything
they're saying?

582
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:13,937
Yes, Master Luke.

583
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:17,065
Remember that I am fluent
in over six million forms...

584
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:18,734
What are you telling them?

585
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,153
Hello, I think.

586
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:23,405
I could be mistaken.

587
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,907
They're using a very primitive dialect.

588
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:28,202
But I do believe they think I am
some sort of god.

589
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:37,461
Why don't you use your divine influence
and get us out of this?

590
01:11:37,878 --> 01:11:40,797
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

591
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:42,799
Proper?

592
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:46,220
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

593
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:47,304
Why, you...

594
01:11:55,687 --> 01:11:56,939
My mistake.

595
01:11:58,565 --> 01:11:59,858
He's an old friend of mine.

596
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:28,512
Hey!

597
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,323
I have a really bad feeling about this.

598
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:11,263
What did he say?

599
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,640
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo,

600
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:17,519
but it appears you are to be the
main course at a banquet in my honour.

601
01:13:29,573 --> 01:13:30,574
Leia!

602
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:31,742
Leia!

603
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,414
Your Royal Highness.

604
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:39,333
But these are my friends.

605
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:45,672
3PO, tell them they must be set free.

606
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:07,569
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

607
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:11,656
3PO, tell them
if they don't do as you wish,

608
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,700
you'll become angry
and use your magic.

609
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:16,203
But, Master Luke,
what magic? I couldn't possibly.

610
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:17,496
Just tell them.

611
01:14:33,804 --> 01:14:34,805
You see, Master Luke?

612
01:14:34,888 --> 01:14:37,599
They didn't believe me,
just as I said they wouldn't.

613
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,351
Wait, wait.

614
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:55,909
Put me down!

615
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,619
Help! Somebody!

616
01:14:58,537 --> 01:14:59,788
Somebody, help!

617
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:02,207
Master Luke! R2, R2, quickly!

618
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:35,740
Thank goodness.

619
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:49,754
Thanks, 3PO.

620
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:52,299
I never knew I had it in me.

621
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:27,000
Yes, R2,
I was just coming to that.

622
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:47,938
Han Solo.

623
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:17,259
What's going on?

624
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:18,843
I don't know.

625
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:35,235
Wonderful.
We are now a part of the tribe.

626
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:38,613
Just what I always wanted.

627
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,377
Short help's better than no help at all.

628
01:17:58,258 --> 01:17:59,801
He says the scouts
are going to show us

629
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,386
the quickest way
to the shield generator.

630
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:04,431
Good. How far is it? Ask him.

631
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:08,268
We need some fresh supplies, too.

632
01:18:09,436 --> 01:18:10,687
Try and get our weapons back.

633
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:14,107
Hurry up, will you?
I haven't got all day.

634
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:18,403
Luke, what's wrong?

635
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:25,035
Leia, do you remember your mother,
your real mother?

636
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:29,664
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

637
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:31,708
What do you remember?

638
01:18:32,042 --> 01:18:34,628
Just images, really. Feelings.

639
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:36,046
Tell me.

640
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:40,383
She was very beautiful.

641
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:43,887
Kind, but sad.

642
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:48,433
Why are you asking me this?

643
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,353
I have no memory of my mother.

644
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:54,022
I never knew her.

645
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:58,360
Luke, tell me, what's troubling you?

646
01:19:03,323 --> 01:19:04,824
Vader is here.

647
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:06,868
Now. On this moon.

648
01:19:08,912 --> 01:19:10,538
How do you know?

649
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:12,582
I felt his presence.

650
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:14,876
He's come for me.

651
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:16,878
He can feel when I'm near.

652
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:18,797
That's why I have to go.

653
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:23,134
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

654
01:19:23,343 --> 01:19:24,886
I have to face him.

655
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:26,388
Why?

656
01:19:31,226 --> 01:19:33,019
He's my father.

657
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:38,608
Your father?

658
01:19:40,235 --> 01:19:41,486
There's more.

659
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:44,280
It won't be easy for you to hear it,
but you must.

660
01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:47,325
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

661
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:48,910
Luke, don't talk that way.

662
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:53,123
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

663
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:55,208
You're wrong, Leia.

664
01:19:55,709 --> 01:19:57,627
You have that power, too.

665
01:19:57,836 --> 01:20:00,547
In time, you'll learn to use it
as I have.

666
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:07,721
The Force is strong in my family.

667
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:11,015
My father has it.

668
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,394
I have it.

669
01:20:14,602 --> 01:20:15,854
And

670
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:19,023
my sister has it.

671
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,532
Yes.

672
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:29,534
It's you, Leia.

673
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:35,832
I know.

674
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,087
Somehow,

675
01:20:42,464 --> 01:20:43,882
I've always known.

676
01:20:43,965 --> 01:20:45,967
Then you know why I have to face him.

677
01:20:46,176 --> 01:20:50,221
No! Luke, run away. Far away.

678
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:53,725
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

679
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:55,268
I wish I could go with you.

680
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:57,437
No, you don't.

681
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,314
You've always been strong.

682
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,692
But why must you confront him?

683
01:21:02,901 --> 01:21:05,236
Because there is good in him.

684
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,571
I've felt it.

685
01:21:07,113 --> 01:21:08,823
He won't turn me over to the Emperor.

686
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:12,076
I can save him.
I can turn him back to the good side.

687
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:14,746
I have to try.

688
01:21:33,932 --> 01:21:35,850
Hey, what's going on?

689
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:38,269
Nothing.

690
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:41,523
I just want to be alone
for a little while.

691
01:21:42,232 --> 01:21:44,067
Nothing?

692
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,654
Come on, tell me. What's going on?

693
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:53,493
I...

694
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:54,994
I can't tell you.

695
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:59,249
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

696
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,751
I...

697
01:22:16,975 --> 01:22:18,184
I'm sorry.

698
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:23,606
Hold me.

699
01:23:17,702 --> 01:23:19,412
This is the rebel
that surrendered to us.

700
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:22,123
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them,

701
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:25,084
and I request permission
to conduct a further search of the area.

702
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:28,004
He was armed only with this.

703
01:23:30,882 --> 01:23:32,759
Good work, Commander.

704
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:34,469
Leave us.

705
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:38,348
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

706
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:40,934
Yes, my lord.

707
01:23:43,353 --> 01:23:45,772
The Emperor has been expecting you.

708
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:48,608
I know, Father.

709
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:52,403
So, you have accepted the truth.

710
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:57,075
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

711
01:23:57,158 --> 01:24:00,286
That name no longer
has any meaning for me.

712
01:24:00,912 --> 01:24:03,873
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

713
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,084
I know there is good in you.

714
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:09,963
The Emperor hasn't driven it
from you fully.

715
01:24:12,924 --> 01:24:15,927
That was why you couldn't destroy me.

716
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:19,180
That's why you won't bring me
to your Emperor now.

717
01:24:26,062 --> 01:24:29,148
I see you have constructed
a new lightsaber.

718
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,738
Your skills are complete.

719
01:24:40,827 --> 01:24:45,206
Indeed you are powerful,
as the Emperor has foreseen.

720
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:52,296
Come with me.

721
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:57,385
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

722
01:24:58,553 --> 01:25:03,141
You don't know
the power of the dark side.

723
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:06,227
I must obey my master.

724
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:10,314
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

725
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:14,110
If that is your destiny.

726
01:25:14,986 --> 01:25:18,448
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

727
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:21,409
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

728
01:25:22,452 --> 01:25:25,621
It is too late for me, son.

729
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,546
The Emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

730
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:36,966
He is your master now.

731
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:43,139
Then my father is truly dead.

732
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:28,059
The main entrance
to the control bunker

733
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:30,853
is on the far side
of that landing platform.

734
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:33,189
This isn't going to be easy.

735
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,316
Hey, don't worry.

736
01:26:35,525 --> 01:26:38,569
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

737
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:48,579
What's he saying?

738
01:26:48,663 --> 01:26:51,499
He says there's a secret
entrance on the other side of the ridge.

739
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:13,020
Admiral, we're in position.

740
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:14,605
All fighters accounted for.

741
01:27:15,273 --> 01:27:17,817
Proceed with the countdown.

742
01:27:18,484 --> 01:27:21,154
All groups assume attack coordinates.

743
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:26,534
Don't worry. My friend's down there.

744
01:27:26,617 --> 01:27:28,703
He'll have that shield down on time.

745
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:34,750
Or this will be
the shortest offensive of all time.

746
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:40,131
All craft, prepare to jump
into hyperspace on my mark.

747
01:27:40,548 --> 01:27:41,924
All right. Stand by.

748
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:03,696
Back door, huh? Good idea.

749
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:14,624
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

750
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,924
It only takes one
to sound the alarm.

751
01:28:23,549 --> 01:28:25,551
Then we'll do it real quiet like.

752
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:28,471
Oh, my! Princess Leia!

753
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:34,143
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone
and done something rather rash.

754
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:37,480
Oh, no.

755
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:41,192
There goes our surprise attack.

756
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:51,160
Look, over there! Stop him!

757
01:29:02,922 --> 01:29:04,173
Not bad for a little furball.

758
01:29:04,298 --> 01:29:05,549
There's only one left.

759
01:29:05,883 --> 01:29:06,926
You stay here.

760
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:08,552
We'll take care of this.

761
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,890
I have decided that we shall stay here.

762
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,255
Hey!

763
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:50,821
Welcome, young Skywalker.

764
01:30:50,946 --> 01:30:54,283
I have been expecting you.

765
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:56,160
You'll no longer need those.

766
01:31:01,749 --> 01:31:04,043
Guards, leave us.

767
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:13,928
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

768
01:31:14,428 --> 01:31:19,100
In time, you will call me master.

769
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,394
You're gravely mistaken.

770
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,522
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

771
01:31:25,022 --> 01:31:28,984
No, my young Jedi.

772
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:35,199
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken

773
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,955
about a great many things.

774
01:31:42,415 --> 01:31:44,125
His lightsaber.

775
01:31:44,208 --> 01:31:47,336
Yes. A Jedi's weapon.

776
01:31:48,796 --> 01:31:51,006
Much like your father's.

777
01:31:51,215 --> 01:31:56,053
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

778
01:31:56,262 --> 01:31:58,305
So will it be with you.

779
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:01,100
You're wrong.

780
01:32:01,308 --> 01:32:04,228
Soon I'll be dead, and you with me.

781
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:12,069
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

782
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,530
Yes.

783
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:19,493
I assure you, we are quite safe
from your friends here.

784
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:23,497
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

785
01:32:23,998 --> 01:32:26,709
Your faith in your friends is yours.

786
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:32,673
It is pointless to resist, my son.

787
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:42,308
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

788
01:32:42,766 --> 01:32:45,895
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon

789
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:50,024
are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

790
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:54,695
It was I who allowed the Alliance

791
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:57,823
to know the location
of the shield generator.

792
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:02,703
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

793
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:07,041
An entire legion of my best troops
awaits them.

794
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:13,130
Oh, I'm afraid the deflector shield

795
01:33:13,214 --> 01:33:18,511
will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

796
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,725
All right, up! Move! Come on.

797
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:26,685
Quickly. Quickly.

798
01:33:27,728 --> 01:33:28,854
Chewie.

799
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:32,566
Han, hurry!

800
01:33:32,775 --> 01:33:34,860
The fleet will be here any moment.

801
01:33:36,362 --> 01:33:38,030
Charges! Come on, come on!

802
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,826
Oh, my! They'll be captured!

803
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:47,331
Wait! Wait! Come back!

804
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,460
R2, stay with me.

805
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:53,629
Freeze!

806
01:33:57,508 --> 01:33:58,592
You rebel scum.

807
01:34:19,196 --> 01:34:20,531
All wings report in.

808
01:34:21,323 --> 01:34:22,783
Red Leader standing by.

809
01:34:22,992 --> 01:34:24,577
Grey Leader standing by.

810
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:25,869
Green Leader standing by.

811
01:34:26,662 --> 01:34:28,664
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

812
01:34:32,793 --> 01:34:34,753
May the Force be with us.

813
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:41,135
We've got to get a reading
on that shield.

814
01:34:43,304 --> 01:34:46,682
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know

815
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,267
if we're coming.

816
01:34:48,559 --> 01:34:49,810
Break off the attack!

817
01:34:50,311 --> 01:34:51,895
The shield is still up.

818
01:34:52,438 --> 01:34:54,106
I get no reading. You sure?

819
01:34:54,481 --> 01:34:56,400
Pull up! All craft pull up!

820
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,156
Take evasive action.

821
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,908
Green Group,
stick to Holding Sector MV-7.

822
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:09,663
Admiral, we have
enemy ships in Sector 47.

823
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:11,206
It's a trap!

824
01:35:15,002 --> 01:35:16,170
Fighters coming in!

825
01:35:20,257 --> 01:35:21,508
There's too many of them!

826
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:26,680
Accelerate to attack speed.

827
01:35:26,764 --> 01:35:28,265
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

828
01:35:28,349 --> 01:35:29,433
Copy, Gold Leader.

829
01:35:32,853 --> 01:35:34,980
Come, boy.

830
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:36,982
See for yourself.

831
01:35:39,568 --> 01:35:45,074
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance

832
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:48,786
and the end
of your insignificant rebellion.

833
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:56,669
You want this,

834
01:35:56,919 --> 01:35:59,254
don't you?

835
01:35:59,463 --> 01:36:03,300
The hate is swelling in you now.

836
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:06,845
Take your Jedi weapon.

837
01:36:07,054 --> 01:36:08,514
Use it.

838
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:10,516
I am unarmed.

839
01:36:10,808 --> 01:36:12,810
Strike me down with it.

840
01:36:13,018 --> 01:36:15,896
Give in to your anger.

841
01:36:16,563 --> 01:36:21,944
With each passing moment,
you make yourself more my servant.

842
01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:27,991
No.

843
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:30,202
It is unavoidable.

844
01:36:31,036 --> 01:36:33,247
It is your destiny.

845
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:37,167
You, like your father,

846
01:36:37,876 --> 01:36:39,086
are now

847
01:36:40,212 --> 01:36:41,672
mine.

848
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,817
All right, move it!

849
01:37:03,777 --> 01:37:06,238
Keep moving. Come on.

850
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,161
Hello! I say, over there!

851
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:14,037
Were you looking for me?

852
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:18,625
Bring those two down here.

853
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:27,509
Well, they're on their way.

854
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:29,636
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

855
01:37:30,387 --> 01:37:31,472
Freeze!

856
01:37:32,306 --> 01:37:33,307
Don't move!

857
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,142
We surrender.

858
01:39:40,893 --> 01:39:44,354
The code's changed. We need R2.

859
01:39:44,563 --> 01:39:45,647
Here's the terminal.

860
01:39:45,731 --> 01:39:49,401
R2, where are you?
We need you at the bunker right away.

861
01:39:51,695 --> 01:39:53,196
What do you mean, you're going?

862
01:39:55,532 --> 01:39:56,950
Going where, R2?

863
01:39:57,034 --> 01:39:58,493
No, wait!

864
01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:00,787
This is no time for heroics!

865
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:02,372
Come back!

866
01:40:28,815 --> 01:40:30,651
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

867
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:32,277
Red 3, Red 2, pull in.

868
01:40:32,361 --> 01:40:33,570
Got it.

869
01:40:36,907 --> 01:40:38,700
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

870
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:40,494
Cut to the left. I'll take the leader.

871
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:50,420
They're heading for the medical frigate.

872
01:40:56,176 --> 01:40:57,427
Pressure steady.

873
01:41:06,186 --> 01:41:07,270
Only the fighters are attacking.

874
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:09,272
I wonder what those Star Destroyers
are waiting for.

875
01:41:13,902 --> 01:41:15,654
We're in attack position, sir.

876
01:41:15,737 --> 01:41:17,155
Hold here.

877
01:41:17,364 --> 01:41:19,032
We're not going to attack?

878
01:41:19,116 --> 01:41:20,617
I have my orders
from the Emperor himself.

879
01:41:20,701 --> 01:41:22,327
He has something special
planned for them.

880
01:41:22,411 --> 01:41:24,204
We only need to keep them
from escaping.

881
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:30,002
As you can see,
my young apprentice,

882
01:41:30,252 --> 01:41:33,380
your friends have failed.

883
01:41:34,256 --> 01:41:36,842
Now witness the firepower

884
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:42,097
of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

885
01:41:43,515 --> 01:41:45,392
Fire at will, Commander.

886
01:41:52,899 --> 01:41:53,984
Fire.

887
01:42:01,658 --> 01:42:03,535
That blast came from the Death Star.

888
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:06,830
That thing's operational!

889
01:42:07,497 --> 01:42:09,082
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

890
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:11,293
All craft prepare to retreat.

891
01:42:11,376 --> 01:42:13,628
You won't get another chance
at this, Admiral.

892
01:42:13,712 --> 01:42:16,548
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

893
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:19,926
Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

894
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,595
Han will have that shield down.

895
01:42:21,678 --> 01:42:23,638
We've got to give him more time.

896
01:42:42,616 --> 01:42:43,909
We're coming!

897
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:50,916
Come on, come on!

898
01:42:55,295 --> 01:42:56,379
R2, hurry!

899
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:03,762
Oh, my goodness!

900
01:43:10,102 --> 01:43:11,478
Why did you have to be so brave?

901
01:43:14,439 --> 01:43:17,526
Well, I suppose
I could hot-wire this thing.

902
01:43:17,734 --> 01:43:18,735
I'll cover you.

903
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:01,486
Yes, I said closer.

904
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:02,612
Move as close as you can

905
01:44:02,696 --> 01:44:05,615
and engage those Star Destroyers
at point-blank range!

906
01:44:05,866 --> 01:44:09,202
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Star Destroyers.

907
01:44:09,286 --> 01:44:12,080
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star!

908
01:44:12,164 --> 01:44:14,124
And we might just take
a few of them with us.

909
01:44:17,419 --> 01:44:18,503
She's going to blow!

910
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:23,842
I'm hit!

911
01:44:29,347 --> 01:44:31,474
Your fleet is lost,

912
01:44:31,558 --> 01:44:35,437
and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

913
01:44:37,814 --> 01:44:40,358
There is no escape,

914
01:44:40,567 --> 01:44:42,819
my young apprentice.

915
01:44:45,155 --> 01:44:47,824
The Alliance will die,

916
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:52,954
as will your friends.

917
01:44:56,291 --> 01:44:57,709
Good.

918
01:44:58,668 --> 01:45:01,755
I can feel your anger.

919
01:45:03,423 --> 01:45:04,925
I am defenceless.

920
01:45:05,634 --> 01:45:07,010
Take your weapon.

921
01:45:07,177 --> 01:45:10,222
Strike me down with all of your hatred,

922
01:45:10,305 --> 01:45:14,184
and your journey towards the dark side
will be complete!

923
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:54,891
Look!

924
01:45:54,975 --> 01:45:56,601
Get him off of there!

925
01:47:49,631 --> 01:47:50,882
I think I got it.

926
01:47:51,633 --> 01:47:52,801
I got it!

927
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:01,393
Princess Leia, are you all right?

928
01:48:01,476 --> 01:48:03,395
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

929
01:48:03,478 --> 01:48:04,813
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

930
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:06,940
Don't move!

931
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,112
I love you.

932
01:48:12,529 --> 01:48:13,738
I know.

933
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:15,031
Hands up!

934
01:48:16,699 --> 01:48:17,784
Stand up!

935
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:28,711
Stay back.

936
01:48:34,175 --> 01:48:35,260
Chewie!

937
01:48:37,011 --> 01:48:38,221
Get down here! She's wounded!

938
01:48:39,431 --> 01:48:40,432
No, wait!

939
01:48:41,599 --> 01:48:42,809
I got an idea.

940
01:48:54,112 --> 01:48:55,572
Good.

941
01:48:56,281 --> 01:48:59,617
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

942
01:48:59,826 --> 01:49:02,579
Let the hate flow through you.

943
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:11,379
Obi-Wan
has taught you well.

944
01:49:15,508 --> 01:49:17,552
I will not fight you, Father.

945
01:49:31,774 --> 01:49:35,195
You are unwise to lower your defences.

946
01:49:59,594 --> 01:50:01,804
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

947
01:50:02,013 --> 01:50:04,766
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

948
01:50:05,266 --> 01:50:07,685
There is no conflict.

949
01:50:10,104 --> 01:50:11,856
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before.

950
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:14,025
I don't believe you'll destroy me now.

951
01:50:14,526 --> 01:50:18,863
You underestimate
the power of the dark side.

952
01:50:18,947 --> 01:50:23,117
If you will not fight,
then you will meet your destiny.

953
01:50:34,796 --> 01:50:37,507
Good. Good.

954
01:50:46,558 --> 01:50:48,726
Watch out! Squad at.06.

955
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:50,019
I'm on it, Gold Leader.

956
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:53,106
Good shot, Red 2.

957
01:50:57,026 --> 01:50:58,570
We're sure
in the middle of it now.

958
01:50:58,653 --> 01:51:01,614
Come on, Han, old buddy,
don't let me down.

959
01:51:06,369 --> 01:51:07,912
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

960
01:51:07,996 --> 01:51:10,373
<i>The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing into the woods.</i>

961
01:51:10,456 --> 01:51:13,793
<i>We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.</i>

962
01:51:13,876 --> 01:51:15,503
Send three squads to help.

963
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,630
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

964
01:51:32,562 --> 01:51:33,730
Throw me another charge.

965
01:51:51,247 --> 01:51:53,708
You cannot
hide forever, Luke.

966
01:51:55,376 --> 01:51:57,587
I will not fight you.

967
01:52:00,673 --> 01:52:03,885
Give yourself
to the dark side.

968
01:52:05,261 --> 01:52:09,182
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

969
01:52:10,642 --> 01:52:12,060
Yes.

970
01:52:12,268 --> 01:52:14,270
Your thoughts betray you.

971
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:16,898
Your feelings for them are strong,

972
01:52:17,315 --> 01:52:18,816
especially for...

973
01:52:21,152 --> 01:52:22,654
sister.

974
01:52:23,988 --> 01:52:25,073
So,

975
01:52:25,156 --> 01:52:27,950
you have a twin sister.

976
01:52:28,576 --> 01:52:32,163
Your feelings
have now betrayed her, too.

977
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:36,334
Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me.

978
01:52:36,542 --> 01:52:40,463
Now his failure is complete.

979
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:45,551
If you will not turn to the dark side,

980
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:49,180
then perhaps she will.

981
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:50,264
Never!

982
01:53:35,601 --> 01:53:37,186
Good!

983
01:53:41,941 --> 01:53:44,610
Your hate has made you powerful.

984
01:53:45,695 --> 01:53:47,488
Now,

985
01:53:47,697 --> 01:53:50,116
fulfil your destiny

986
01:53:50,992 --> 01:53:54,871
and take your father's place at my side.

987
01:54:09,844 --> 01:54:11,053
Never.

988
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:16,350
I'll never turn to the dark side.

989
01:54:19,687 --> 01:54:21,439
You've failed, Your Highness.

990
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:24,192
I am a Jedi,

991
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,402
like my father before me.

992
01:54:34,243 --> 01:54:35,870
So be it,

993
01:54:36,078 --> 01:54:37,205
Jedi.

994
01:54:38,039 --> 01:54:39,123
Move!

995
01:54:39,332 --> 01:54:40,416
Move!

996
01:54:52,512 --> 01:54:53,554
The shield is down!

997
01:54:53,638 --> 01:54:56,307
Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor!

998
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,642
We're on our way.

999
01:54:57,725 --> 01:55:00,144
Red Group, Gold Group,
all fighters follow me.

1000
01:55:00,228 --> 01:55:02,230
I told you they'd do it!

1001
01:55:09,153 --> 01:55:11,948
If you will not be turned,

1002
01:55:12,657 --> 01:55:15,326
you will be destroyed.

1003
01:55:22,375 --> 01:55:24,836
Young fool.

1004
01:55:25,044 --> 01:55:30,341
Only now, at the end, do you understand.

1005
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:48,651
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

1006
01:55:52,905 --> 01:55:56,242
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

1007
01:56:02,123 --> 01:56:03,666
Father, please!

1008
01:56:08,963 --> 01:56:10,631
Help me!

1009
01:56:19,307 --> 01:56:21,434
Now, young Skywalker,

1010
01:56:23,519 --> 01:56:25,271
you will die.

1011
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:52,965
No.

1012
01:56:55,259 --> 01:56:56,510
No!

1013
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:49,522
I'm going in.

1014
01:57:52,858 --> 01:57:53,985
Here goes nothing.

1015
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:03,202
Now lock onto
the strongest power source.

1016
01:58:03,285 --> 01:58:05,121
It should be the power generator.

1017
01:58:07,498 --> 01:58:08,874
Form up. Stay alert.

1018
01:58:08,958 --> 01:58:10,626
We could run out of space real fast.

1019
01:58:26,517 --> 01:58:28,436
Split up and head back to the surface.

1020
01:58:28,519 --> 01:58:31,731
See if you can get a few
of those TIE fighters to follow you.

1021
01:58:31,814 --> 01:58:32,815
Copy, Gold Leader.

1022
01:58:43,117 --> 01:58:44,493
That was too close.

1023
01:58:48,664 --> 01:58:50,875
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

1024
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:54,045
Concentrate all fire
on that Super Star Destroyer.

1025
01:59:00,051 --> 01:59:02,303
Sir, we've lost
our bridge deflector shields.

1026
01:59:02,386 --> 01:59:04,013
Intensify the forward batteries.

1027
01:59:04,096 --> 01:59:05,306
I don't want anything to get through!

1028
01:59:07,933 --> 01:59:09,602
Intensify forward firepower!

1029
01:59:11,604 --> 01:59:13,022
Too late!

1030
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:57,566
Luke.

1031
01:59:57,775 --> 02:00:01,195
Help me take this mask off.

1032
02:00:02,029 --> 02:00:04,406
But you'll die.

1033
02:00:04,615 --> 02:00:08,035
Nothing can stop that now.

1034
02:00:09,203 --> 02:00:10,746
Just for once,

1035
02:00:11,664 --> 02:00:16,919
let me look on you with my own eyes.

1036
02:00:53,164 --> 02:00:54,248
Now,

1037
02:00:54,999 --> 02:00:56,876
go, my son.

1038
02:00:59,378 --> 02:01:00,796
Leave me.

1039
02:01:01,672 --> 02:01:03,549
No. You're coming with me.

1040
02:01:04,633 --> 02:01:06,677
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

1041
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:11,098
You already have, Luke.

1042
02:01:12,433 --> 02:01:14,101
You were right.

1043
02:01:15,019 --> 02:01:17,521
You were right about me.

1044
02:01:19,356 --> 02:01:21,025
Tell your sister

1045
02:01:22,735 --> 02:01:24,945
you were right.

1046
02:01:31,452 --> 02:01:32,536
Father.

1047
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:38,250
I won't leave you.

1048
02:02:03,776 --> 02:02:04,777
There it is.

1049
02:02:07,655 --> 02:02:10,074
All right, Wedge, go for
the power regulator on the north tower.

1050
02:02:10,157 --> 02:02:13,160
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

1051
02:02:32,721 --> 02:02:35,099
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

1052
02:03:23,397 --> 02:03:24,606
They did it!

1053
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,534
I'm sure Luke
wasn't on that thing when it blew.

1054
02:03:37,286 --> 02:03:38,495
He wasn't.

1055
02:03:39,496 --> 02:03:41,373
I can feel it.

1056
02:03:45,753 --> 02:03:47,296
You love him.

1057
02:03:50,632 --> 02:03:51,842
Don't you?

1058
02:03:52,551 --> 02:03:53,635
Yes.

1059
02:03:54,136 --> 02:03:56,305
All right. I understand.

1060
02:03:56,889 --> 02:03:57,973
Fine.

1061
02:03:59,266 --> 02:04:00,768
When he comes back,

1062
02:04:02,227 --> 02:04:03,645
I won't get in the way.

1063
02:04:06,565 --> 02:04:08,233
It's not like that at all.

1064
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:13,405
He's my brother.

1065
02:05:55,799 --> 02:05:57,801
Wesa free!
