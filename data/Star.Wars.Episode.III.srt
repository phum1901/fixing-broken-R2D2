1
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:09,567
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:13,112
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead...

3
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:15,448
the one crawling with vulture droids.

4
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:18,075
I see it. This is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,294
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:30,671
Mark my position. Form
your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,673
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:34,717
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,650
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:52,777
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:13,422
They're all over me. Get them off my...

12
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,466
- I'm gonna go help them out.
- No.

13
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,302
No, they are doing their
job so we can do ours.

14
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:34,819
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:38,823
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,997
All right, R4.

17
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:48,666
No, no, no, no... No, nothing too fancy.

18
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:55,631
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

19
00:05:03,432 --> 00:05:07,018
We got 'em, R2.

20
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,361
Flying is for droids.

21
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:28,372
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them. Buzz droids.

22
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:38,007
R4, be careful. You have a-

23
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,054
Dear.

24
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:47,016
They're shutting down all the controls.

25
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,144
- Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
- The mission.

26
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:54,106
Get to the command ship. Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

27
00:05:56,985 --> 00:06:01,280
In the name of...

28
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:07,578
- Hold your fire! You're not helping here.
- I agree. Bad idea.

29
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,754
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

30
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:21,926
They're all over me. Anakin!

31
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,641
- Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin. You're gonna get us both killed.

32
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,104
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

33
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:35,398
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

34
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:47,201
Get him, R2.

35
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:50,663
Watch out.

36
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:57,586
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

37
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:07,138
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

38
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,350
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

39
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:15,521
Well, have you noticed the
shields are still up?

40
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:17,648
Sorry, Master.

41
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:27,283
I have a bad feeling about this.

42
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,258
There they are. Get them.

43
00:07:53,643 --> 00:07:57,771
R2, locate the chancellor.

44
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:08,866
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there...

45
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,036
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

46
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,038
I sense Count Dooku.

47
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:17,458
I sense a trap.
Next move?

48
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:21,128
Spring the trap.

49
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:24,423
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

50
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,425
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

51
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:44,235
What's the situation, Captain?

52
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:48,280
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

53
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:52,660
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

54
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,915
Destroyers.

55
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,926
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

56
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:10,553
Roger.
Roger, roger.

57
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:11,845
Roger, roger.

58
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,397
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:28,028
Did you press the stop button?
No. Did you?

60
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:31,407
- No.
- Well, there's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,325
We don't want to get out.

62
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:39,123
We want to get moving.
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:41,417
Come in, R2.
What that?

64
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,419
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:45,421
R2, activate the elevator number...

66
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,756
31174.

67
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:50,801
Get back to work. That nothin'.

68
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:53,846
Activate the elevator 31174.

69
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,848
R2, we...

70
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,564
Always on the move.

71
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:05,566
R2, switch on the comlink.

72
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,693
R2, can you hear me?

73
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:10,237
R2?

74
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:11,614
Whoa!

75
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,824
R2! R2!

76
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:20,664
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

77
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:25,002
Hands up, Jedi.

78
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,296
R2, do you copy?

79
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,383
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

80
00:10:36,222 --> 00:10:39,224
Hey, you!

81
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:44,313
Now, that's better.

82
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:48,692
You stupid little astro droid.

83
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,746
It's you.

84
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,708
My eyes! My eyes!

85
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:07,252
What was that all about?
Well, R2 has been...

86
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:10,297
No loose wire jokes.
Did I say anything?

87
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,383
He's trying.
I didn't say anything.

88
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:51,922
Chancellor.
Are you all right?

89
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:54,633
Count Dooku.

90
00:11:58,221 --> 00:12:02,099
This time we will do it together.
I was about to say that.

91
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:14,236
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

92
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,407
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

93
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:21,410
Your swords, please.

94
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:24,997
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

95
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,332
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

96
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,262
I've been looking forward to this.

97
00:12:40,346 --> 00:12:43,557
My powers have doubled
since the last time we met, Count.

98
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:47,144
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

99
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,207
Get-

100
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:38,529
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

101
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:42,282
You have hate. You have anger.

102
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,326
But you don't use them.

103
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,724
Good, Anakin. Good.

104
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:09,852
Kill him.

105
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:12,896
Kill him now.

106
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,445
I shouldn't.

107
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:24,408
Do it.

108
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:39,339
You did well, Anakin.

109
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:43,385
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

110
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,888
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

111
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:48,849
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

112
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:54,104
It is only natural. He cut off
your arm, and you wanted revenge.

113
00:14:54,188 --> 00:14:57,232
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

114
00:14:57,317 --> 00:15:01,111
Remember what you told me
about your mother and the Sand People?

115
00:15:03,865 --> 00:15:07,492
Now we must leave
before more security droids arrive.

116
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:14,875
Anakin, there's no time.

117
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,211
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

118
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:22,341
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

119
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:25,135
His fate will be the same as ours.

120
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:31,767
Prepare for attack!

121
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:35,979
All batteries, fire! Fire!

122
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,950
Elevator's not working.

123
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:54,331
R2, activate elevator 3224.

124
00:16:13,017 --> 00:16:16,269
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

125
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,708
Magnetize! Magnetize!

126
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:47,592
Fire the emergency booster engines.

127
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:54,516
We're leveling out, sir.

128
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:12,409
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

129
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:15,162
Did I miss something?
Hold on.

130
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:17,456
- What is that?
- Oops.

131
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,541
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

132
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,585
Too late. Jump!

133
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:38,810
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

134
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:41,021
R2, get down here.

135
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:43,398
R2, do you copy?

136
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,030
General, we found the Jedi.

137
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:54,618
They're in hallway 328.
Activate ray shields.

138
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:58,872
Ray shields.

139
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:00,832
Wait a minute. How did this happen?

140
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,335
We're smarter than this.
Apparently not.

141
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:08,507
I say patience.
Patience?

142
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:11,885
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments,

143
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:15,263
and then... he'll release the ray shields.

144
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:24,106
See? No problem.

145
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:28,360
Don't move.

146
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:34,282
Do you have a plan "B"?

147
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:44,543
Yes. The negotiator.

148
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:48,880
General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

149
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:51,133
Excuse me.

150
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:54,010
That wasn't much of a rescue.
You're welcome.

151
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:56,555
And...

152
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,432
Anakin Skywalker.

153
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:05,272
I was expecting someone with your
reputation to be a little... older.

154
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:11,653
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

155
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:16,283
Jedi scum.

156
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,161
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

157
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:28,628
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition
to my collection.

158
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:32,424
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

159
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,759
R2.

160
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:41,224
Crush them!

161
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,393
Make them suffer!

162
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:49,107
Come. Now!

163
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:51,401
Stay at your stations!
Whoa!

164
00:19:58,034 --> 00:20:00,577
Get him! Get him!

165
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:20,805
Run!

166
00:20:24,352 --> 00:20:27,896
Don't bother with them. Keep
the ship in orbit. Yes, sir.

167
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:41,618
You lose, General Kenobi.

168
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:07,519
Get out of here! Run!

169
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:23,159
Time to abandon ship.

170
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,794
All the escape pods
have been launched.

171
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:35,922
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

172
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:39,092
You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing? Well?

173
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:42,762
Well, under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

174
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:44,055
Strap yourselves in.

175
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:48,685
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

176
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:07,579
We lost something.

177
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:10,165
Not to worry. We are still
flying half a ship.

178
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:17,422
Now we're really picking up speed.

179
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,807
Eight plus 60.

180
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:32,020
We're in the atmosphere.
Grab that. Keep us level.

181
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,286
Steady.

182
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:51,039
Easy, R2.

183
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,921
5000. Fire ships on the left and the right.

184
00:22:58,005 --> 00:23:00,757
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

185
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:06,930
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

186
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:40,004
Another happy landing.

187
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:14,205
- Are you coming, Master?
- No. I'm not brave enough for politics.

188
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,207
I have to report to the council.

189
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:18,751
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

190
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:22,714
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

191
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,925
Let us not forget, Anakin,
that you rescued me from the buzz droids.

192
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,470
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor,

193
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:30,472
carrying me unconscious on your back.

194
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:33,099
All because of your training.

195
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:36,728
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero,

196
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:39,898
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

197
00:24:39,982 --> 00:24:44,068
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

198
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:48,406
Ninth time. That business on Cato Neimoidia
doesn't... doesn't count.

199
00:24:48,491 --> 00:24:50,408
I'll see you at the briefing.

200
00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:58,291
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

201
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,294
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

202
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:06,090
They killed Count Dooku, but General
Grievous has escaped once again.

203
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:09,719
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

204
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:14,140
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

205
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:19,979
And I assure you, the senate will vote to
continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

206
00:25:20,064 --> 00:25:24,150
Then the Jedi Council will make finding
Grievous our highest priority.

207
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:27,487
Watch it.
Excuse me.

208
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:30,615
Come along, R2.
The Republic cannot praise you enough.

209
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:32,784
Thank you, Senator Organa.

210
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,454
Well, it couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

211
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,540
Now there I agree with you.

212
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:42,001
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

213
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:47,257
But the fighting will continue
until General Grievous is spare parts.

214
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:49,801
Well, I will do everything
I can in the senate.

215
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:52,220
Excuse me.
Certainly.

216
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:04,774
Anakin.

217
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:09,529
I've missed you, Padmé.

218
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:13,950
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

219
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:16,619
I'm all right.

220
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:19,706
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

221
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,625
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

222
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,962
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

223
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:28,840
Wait. Not here.
Yes, here.

224
00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:32,427
I'm... I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

225
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:34,804
Anakin, don't say things like that.

226
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:47,233
Are you all right? You're trembling.

227
00:26:47,318 --> 00:26:49,485
What's going on?

228
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,781
Something wonderful has happened.

229
00:26:55,784 --> 00:26:58,995
Ani, I'm pregnant.

230
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,876
That's...

231
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:12,592
Well, that's won... That's wonderful.

232
00:27:14,303 --> 00:27:17,347
What are we gonna do?

233
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:22,226
We're not gonna worry about anything
right now. All right?

234
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:24,812
This is a happy moment.

235
00:27:26,774 --> 00:27:29,108
The happiest moment of my life.

236
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:38,094
Yes, Lord Sidious?

237
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:40,096
General Grievous,

238
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,309
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

239
00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:49,272
It will be done, my lord.

240
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:53,651
The end of the war is near, General.

241
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:57,363
But the loss of Count Dooku-

242
00:28:57,448 --> 00:29:01,784
His death was a necessary loss.

243
00:29:01,869 --> 00:29:06,038
Soon I will have a new apprentice-

244
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:11,419
one far younger and more powerful.

245
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:41,449
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

246
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:44,911
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know,

247
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,913
where we can be safe.

248
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:51,459
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

249
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:58,758
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

250
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:06,349
You are so... beautiful.

251
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:09,977
It's only because I'm so in love.

252
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:12,522
No.

253
00:30:12,606 --> 00:30:15,775
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

254
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:19,487
So love has blinded you?

255
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,324
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.

256
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:26,953
But it's probably true.

257
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:38,089
Anakin, help me!

258
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:43,237
What's bothering you?

259
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:47,658
Nothing.

260
00:31:49,536 --> 00:31:51,913
I remember when I gave this to you.

261
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:56,250
How long is it gonna take
for us to be honest with each other?

262
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:00,713
It was a dream.

263
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:02,965
Bad?

264
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,509
Like the ones I used to have
about my mother,

265
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:07,511
just before she died.

266
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:09,513
And?

267
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:14,310
And it was about you.

268
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:18,814
Tell me.

269
00:32:20,525 --> 00:32:22,485
It was only a dream.

270
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:37,375
You die in childbirth.

271
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:40,252
And the baby?

272
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:42,713
I don't know.

273
00:32:44,174 --> 00:32:46,092
It was only a dream.

274
00:32:46,176 --> 00:32:49,011
I won't let this one become real.

275
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:52,765
This baby will change our lives.

276
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:55,768
I doubt the queen will continue to allow me
to serve in the senate.

277
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:58,604
And if the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

278
00:32:58,689 --> 00:33:01,232
I... I know. I know.

279
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:05,027
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

280
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,073
We don't need his help.

281
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,411
Our baby is a blessing.

282
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:33,764
Premonitions? Premonitions.

283
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:37,018
These visions you have-

284
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:40,730
They're of pain, suffering.

285
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:44,567
Death.

286
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:49,071
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

287
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:52,575
Someone.

288
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:54,577
Close to you?

289
00:33:55,746 --> 00:33:57,997
Yes.

290
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:01,959
Careful you must be
when sensing the future, Anakin.

291
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:06,380
The fear of loss is a
path to the dark side.

292
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:11,886
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

293
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,181
Death is a natural part of life.

294
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:19,977
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

295
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:23,355
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

296
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,567
Attachment leads to jealousy.

297
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:30,112
The shadow of greed that is.

298
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:33,032
What must I do, Master Yoda?

299
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:36,202
Train yourself to let go...

300
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:39,747
of everything you fear to lose.

301
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,885
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

302
00:34:54,304 --> 00:34:56,680
I'm sorry. I was held up.

303
00:34:56,807 --> 00:35:00,392
I have no excuse.
In short, they are going very well.

304
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:05,898
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

305
00:35:05,982 --> 00:35:08,025
What's wrong, then?

306
00:35:09,611 --> 00:35:10,736
The senate is expected...

307
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:14,323
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

308
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:18,786
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

309
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,330
It'll make it easier for
us to end this war.

310
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:25,376
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

311
00:35:27,003 --> 00:35:28,879
Be careful of what?

312
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:31,632
He has requested your presence.
What for?

313
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:36,387
He would not say.
He didn't inform the council?

314
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:39,974
That's unusual, isn't it?
All of this is unusual.

315
00:35:40,058 --> 00:35:42,518
And it's making me feel uneasy.

316
00:35:57,492 --> 00:35:59,410
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

317
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:01,662
Of course.

318
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:04,707
I need your help, son.

319
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:07,835
What do you mean?

320
00:36:07,961 --> 00:36:13,174
I'm depending on you.
For what? I don't understand.

321
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:18,846
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

322
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,098
Anakin,

323
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:25,352
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

324
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:28,731
Me? A master?

325
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:32,234
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

326
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:37,239
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

327
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:40,826
I think they will. They need you.

328
00:36:40,911 --> 00:36:43,370
More than you know.

329
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:58,844
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

330
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:02,389
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

331
00:37:03,558 --> 00:37:05,142
I understand.

332
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:10,314
You are on this council,
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

333
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:12,441
What?

334
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,908
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

335
00:37:20,992 --> 00:37:23,160
It's unfair.

336
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:27,790
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

337
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:31,418
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

338
00:37:34,464 --> 00:37:36,757
Forgive me, Master.

339
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,763
We have surveyed all
systems in the Republic,

340
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:46,600
but have found no sign of General Grievous.

341
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:49,478
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

342
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:52,690
The outlying systems you must sweep.

343
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:55,025
We do not have many ships to spare.

344
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,319
What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?

345
00:37:57,404 --> 00:38:01,115
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

346
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:04,660
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

347
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:08,080
Go I will.

348
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:11,208
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

349
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:15,629
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones...

350
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:18,048
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

351
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:20,217
May the Force be with us all.

352
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:25,097
What kind of nonsense is this?

353
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:27,599
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

354
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:30,436
It's never been done
in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.

355
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,439
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

356
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:37,568
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

357
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:41,071
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

358
00:38:41,156 --> 00:38:44,908
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

359
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:50,789
I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on
the council. But it's what you wanted.

360
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:54,209
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

361
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:56,211
That has nothing to do with this.

362
00:38:56,296 --> 00:38:59,256
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

363
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:02,301
is because the chancellor trusts you.

364
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:05,429
And?
Anakin, I am on your side.

365
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:08,891
I didn't want to put you in this situation.
What situation?

366
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:17,316
The council wants you to report
on all the chancellor's dealings.

367
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,777
They want to know what he's up to.

368
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:27,117
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

369
00:39:27,243 --> 00:39:29,912
But that's treason.
We are at war, Anakin.

370
00:39:31,915 --> 00:39:34,875
Why didn't the council give me this
assignment when we were in session?

371
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:37,419
This assignment is not to be on record.

372
00:39:37,504 --> 00:39:41,465
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

373
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:44,593
He befriended me. He's watched out for me
ever since I arrived here.

374
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:46,804
That is why you must help us.

375
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:50,391
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader,

376
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:54,186
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

377
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,271
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

378
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:59,525
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

379
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:04,196
You're asking me
to do something against the Jedi code,

380
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,033
against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

381
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:11,954
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

382
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:16,166
The council is asking you.

383
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:27,886
Anakin did not take to his new assignment
with much enthusiasm.

384
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:31,181
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

385
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:33,600
I don't think the boy can handle it.

386
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:36,228
I don't trust him.

387
00:40:36,312 --> 00:40:40,190
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

388
00:40:40,275 --> 00:40:43,986
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

389
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,947
So the prophecy says.

390
00:40:47,031 --> 00:40:51,952
A prophecy that misread could have been.

391
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:55,664
He will not let me down.

392
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:57,708
He never has.

393
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:00,836
I hope right you are.

394
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:29,531
Sometimes I wonder
what's happening to the Jedi order.

395
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:32,701
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

396
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:37,748
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

397
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:40,334
What do you mean?

398
00:41:40,418 --> 00:41:45,047
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists,

399
00:41:45,131 --> 00:41:48,759
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

400
00:41:48,843 --> 00:41:50,886
I don't believe that.

401
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,096
And you're sounding like a separatist.

402
00:41:55,058 --> 00:41:58,018
This war represents a failure to listen.

403
00:41:58,102 --> 00:42:00,145
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

404
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,524
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

405
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:06,193
Don't ask me to do that.

406
00:42:07,737 --> 00:42:11,406
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

407
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:14,326
- What is it?
- Nothing.

408
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:19,498
Don't do this.
Don't shut me out. Let me help you.

409
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:23,919
Hold me.

410
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:27,172
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

411
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:31,051
So long ago,
when there was nothing but our love.

412
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:34,596
No politics, no plotting, no war.

413
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:17,180
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin. Come closer.

414
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:19,891
I have good news.

415
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:25,355
Our clone intelligence units have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

416
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,357
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

417
00:43:27,442 --> 00:43:29,359
At last.

418
00:43:30,737 --> 00:43:33,947
We'll be able to capture that monster
and end this war.

419
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:37,409
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

420
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:39,911
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

421
00:43:39,996 --> 00:43:43,373
You're the best choice, by far.

422
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:47,794
Sit down.

423
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:49,796
Leave us.

424
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:03,685
Anakin,

425
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:08,231
you know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

426
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:14,196
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

427
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,406
I'm not sure I understand.

428
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:20,202
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

429
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:23,705
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

430
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,542
They're planning to betray me.

431
00:44:27,669 --> 00:44:30,087
I don't think that-
Anakin.

432
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:33,215
Search your feelings.

433
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:37,969
You know, don't you?

434
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,477
I know they don't trust you.
Or the senate.

435
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:50,399
Or the Republic, or
democracy, for that matter.

436
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:55,529
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

437
00:44:55,613 --> 00:44:57,614
Why?

438
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:01,201
They asked you to do something...

439
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:03,578
that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

440
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:09,459
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

441
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:16,508
I don't,

442
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,510
I don't know what to say.

443
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:22,180
Remember back to your early teachings.

444
00:45:22,265 --> 00:45:26,560
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

445
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:31,356
Even the Jedi.
The Jedi use their power for good.

446
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:33,608
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

447
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:38,905
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way,

448
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:43,702
including their quest for greater power.

449
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:48,248
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

450
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:51,126
They think inwards...
only about themselves.

451
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:54,546
And the Jedi don't?

452
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,217
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

453
00:46:09,395 --> 00:46:14,399
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

454
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:21,072
No.
I thought not.

455
00:46:21,157 --> 00:46:23,575
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.

456
00:46:24,994 --> 00:46:27,370
It's a Sith legend.

457
00:46:27,455 --> 00:46:29,372
Darth Plagueis...

458
00:46:29,457 --> 00:46:35,128
was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise,

459
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:40,091
he could use the Force
to influence the midi-chlorians...

460
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:43,386
to create... life.

461
00:46:45,014 --> 00:46:48,099
He had such a knowledge of the dark side,

462
00:46:48,184 --> 00:46:53,230
he could even keep the
ones he cared about...

463
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:55,232
from dying.

464
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:03,365
He could actually...
save people from death?

465
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:08,745
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway to many abilities...

466
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:13,083
some consider to be unnatural.

467
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:16,044
Wh... What happened to him?

468
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:19,214
He became so powerful,

469
00:47:20,466 --> 00:47:23,468
the only thing he was afraid of was...

470
00:47:23,553 --> 00:47:25,470
losing his power.

471
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:29,015
Which eventually, of course, he did.

472
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:34,980
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
everything he knew.

473
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:38,775
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

474
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,821
It's ironic.

475
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:44,948
He could save others from death,

476
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,159
but not himself.

477
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,875
Is it possible to learn this power?

478
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:00,839
Not from a Jedi.

479
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,608
All Red units, over here!

480
00:48:30,703 --> 00:48:34,497
Palpatine thinks General
Grievous is on Utapau?

481
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:37,626
A partial message was intercepted
in a diplomatic packet...

482
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:40,879
from the chairman of Utapau.

483
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:43,715
Act on this we must.

484
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:48,553
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

485
00:48:48,638 --> 00:48:52,515
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

486
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,646
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

487
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:01,066
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go,

488
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,151
not the chancellor.

489
00:49:03,235 --> 00:49:08,198
A master is needed, with more experience.

490
00:49:08,282 --> 00:49:12,786
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

491
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,246
- I agree.
- Aye.

492
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:17,207
Aye.

493
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:21,086
Very well. Council adjourned.

494
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:29,844
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

495
00:49:29,971 --> 00:49:35,475
Then now the time is, Commander.
Yes, sir.

496
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:49,656
Charge!

497
00:50:04,547 --> 00:50:06,506
Head for cover!

498
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:24,941
You're gonna need me on this one, Master.
I agree.

499
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:29,195
However, it may turn out just to
be a wild Bantha chase. Master.

500
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,453
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

501
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:40,957
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

502
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:43,418
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

503
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:50,467
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

504
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:53,178
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

505
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:55,388
I have taught you everything I know.

506
00:50:55,473 --> 00:50:59,225
And you have become a far greater Jedi
than I could ever hope to be.

507
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,020
But be patient, Anakin.

508
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:06,107
It will not be long before the council
makes you a Jedi master.

509
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:16,743
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

510
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,746
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

511
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:46,856
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

512
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:51,027
On the far side. I'll keep them
distracted until you get there.

513
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:54,572
Just don't take too long. Come on.
When have I ever let you down?

514
00:51:54,657 --> 00:51:56,574
Very well.

515
00:51:56,659 --> 00:52:01,162
The burden is on me not to destroy
all the droids until you arrive.

516
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:28,690
Save your energy.

517
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:30,817
I can't.

518
00:52:30,901 --> 00:52:32,694
Don't give up, Padmé.

519
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:48,626
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

520
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:50,795
He came by this morning.

521
00:52:52,173 --> 00:52:54,090
What did he want?

522
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:56,134
He's worried about you.

523
00:52:58,596 --> 00:53:02,557
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.

524
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:05,435
I feel lost.

525
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:09,731
Lost? What do you mean?

526
00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:13,985
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

527
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:17,530
They trust you with their lives.

528
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:21,326
Something's happening.

529
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,078
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

530
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,374
I want more.

531
00:53:29,585 --> 00:53:31,502
And I know I shouldn't.

532
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:35,590
You expect too much of yourself.

533
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:42,764
I found a way to save you.
Save me?

534
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,807
From my nightmares.

535
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,851
Is that what's bothering you?

536
00:53:47,853 --> 00:53:50,521
I won't lose you, Padmé.

537
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:52,690
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

538
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:55,276
I promise you.
No, I promise you.

539
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:41,614
Greetings, young Jedi.

540
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:45,159
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

541
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:47,203
Unfortunately, the war.

542
00:54:47,288 --> 00:54:51,874
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

543
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:55,169
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

544
00:54:55,254 --> 00:55:01,092
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

545
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:12,437
He is here. We are being held hostage.

546
00:55:12,563 --> 00:55:15,481
They are watching us.
I understand.

547
00:55:15,566 --> 00:55:20,403
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

548
00:55:20,487 --> 00:55:22,947
Tell your people to take shelter.

549
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:26,034
If you have warriors, now is the time.

550
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,132
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

551
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:47,221
Is he bringing additional warriors?
He didn't say.

552
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:34,769
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

553
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:42,610
I am sending you to
the Mustafar system in the outer rim.

554
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:52,412
It is a volcanic planet.

555
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:55,832
You will be safe there.
Safe?

556
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:59,919
Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine
managed to escape your grip, General.

557
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:04,465
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

558
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:07,510
Be thankful, Viceroy,

559
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:10,513
you have not found yourself in my grip.

560
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:17,478
Your ship is waiting.

561
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:35,788
Hello there.

562
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:43,004
General Kenobi.

563
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:45,631
You are a bold one.

564
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:49,177
Kill him.

565
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:07,111
Back away.

566
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:11,157
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

567
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:13,451
Your move.

568
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:15,453
You fool.

569
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:21,209
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

570
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:30,218
Attack, Kenobi.

571
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,860
Go, go, go, go! Move it! Move it!

572
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,946
Everybody out.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

573
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,948
Cover yourself. Come on.

574
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,081
Move it! Move it!

575
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,459
Come on, move!
Come on, everybody!

576
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,879
Army or not,

577
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:54,093
you must realize you are doomed.

578
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:56,178
I don't think so.

579
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:35,009
Hyah!

580
01:00:53,695 --> 01:00:55,946
Cover that corner.

581
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:04,455
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

582
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:07,333
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous,

583
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:09,710
and we have begun our attack.

584
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:12,213
Thank you, Commander.

585
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:15,466
Anakin, deliver this
report to the chancellor.

586
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:18,135
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

587
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:20,388
Yes, Master.

588
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:30,439
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

589
01:01:30,524 --> 01:01:33,150
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

590
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:37,613
If he does not give up his emergency powers
after the destruction of Grievous,

591
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:40,282
then he should be removed from office.

592
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:44,036
The Jedi Council
would have to take control of the senate...

593
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:46,288
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

594
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:50,835
To a dark place
this line of thought will carry us.

595
01:01:50,919 --> 01:01:56,590
Great care we must take.

596
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,807
Chancellor.

597
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:07,435
We've just received
a report from Master Kenobi.

598
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:10,187
He has engaged General Grievous.

599
01:02:10,272 --> 01:02:13,649
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

600
01:02:15,485 --> 01:02:17,486
I should be there with him.

601
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:19,947
It's upsetting to me to
see that the council...

602
01:02:20,031 --> 01:02:23,325
doesn't seem to fully
appreciate your talents.

603
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:27,538
Don't you wonder
why they won't make you a Jedi master?

604
01:02:29,207 --> 01:02:31,208
I wish I knew.

605
01:02:32,502 --> 01:02:35,045
More and more I get the feeling that...

606
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,381
I'm being excluded from the council.

607
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:48,309
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

608
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,938
They don't trust you, Anakin.

609
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:55,733
They see your future.

610
01:02:55,817 --> 01:03:00,780
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

611
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:06,660
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

612
01:03:07,954 --> 01:03:12,082
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

613
01:03:12,167 --> 01:03:14,960
How do you know
the ways of the Force?

614
01:03:15,045 --> 01:03:19,757
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

615
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:22,843
Even the nature of the dark side.

616
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:27,139
You know the dark side?

617
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:29,683
Anakin,

618
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:33,103
if one is to understand the great mystery,

619
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:35,773
one must study all its aspects,

620
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:38,818
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

621
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:42,738
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader,

622
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:46,492
you must embrace
a larger view of the Force.

623
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:49,203
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

624
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:51,497
Only through me...

625
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:55,459
can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi.

626
01:03:55,544 --> 01:03:58,879
Learn to know the dark side of the Force,

627
01:03:58,964 --> 01:04:02,633
and you will be able to save your wife...

628
01:04:02,717 --> 01:04:04,802
from certain death.

629
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,805
What did you say?

630
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:11,559
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

631
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:15,437
You're the Sith lord.

632
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:19,400
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

633
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:24,071
Don't continue to be a
pawn of the Jedi Council.

634
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:29,660
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

635
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:32,329
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

636
01:04:32,414 --> 01:04:34,832
A life of significance,

637
01:04:34,916 --> 01:04:37,293
of conscience.

638
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:45,718
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

639
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:49,179
I know you would.

640
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:53,100
I can feel your anger.

641
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:55,895
It gives you focus,

642
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,355
makes you stronger.

643
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:08,741
I'm going to turn you over to the
Jedi Council. Of course. You should.

644
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:11,869
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

645
01:05:11,953 --> 01:05:15,539
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

646
01:05:15,624 --> 01:05:18,042
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

647
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:21,795
Know the power of the dark side.

648
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,673
Power to save Padmé.

649
01:07:32,427 --> 01:07:34,344
So uncivilized.

650
01:07:41,853 --> 01:07:43,896
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

651
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,067
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

652
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:52,112
We're on our way to make sure the chancellor
returns emergency power back to the senate.

653
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:55,949
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

654
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:59,161
I think Chancellor
Palpatine is a Sith lord.

655
01:07:59,245 --> 01:08:01,205
A Sith lord?

656
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:04,124
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

657
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:08,212
How do you know this?
He knows the ways of the Force.

658
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:10,422
He's been trained to use the dark side.

659
01:08:10,548 --> 01:08:13,383
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

660
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:17,054
Then our worst fears have been realized.

661
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:20,641
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

662
01:08:20,725 --> 01:08:23,185
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

663
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:25,562
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

664
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:28,607
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

665
01:08:28,691 --> 01:08:31,485
I sense a great deal of confusion in you,
young Skywalker.

666
01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:33,695
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

667
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:36,031
I must go, Master.
No.

668
01:08:37,992 --> 01:08:39,993
If what you've told me is true,

669
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:41,995
you will have gained my trust.

670
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,665
But for now, remain here.

671
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,669
Wait in the council
chambers until we return.

672
01:08:50,004 --> 01:08:52,214
Yes, Master.

673
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:24,580
You do know, don't you,

674
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:27,040
if the Jedi destroy me,

675
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:31,128
any chance of saving her will be lost.

676
01:11:00,009 --> 01:11:04,471
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

677
01:11:04,555 --> 01:11:07,849
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

678
01:11:07,934 --> 01:11:11,561
In the name of the Galactic Senate
of the Republic,

679
01:11:11,646 --> 01:11:13,605
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

680
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:16,316
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

681
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:18,360
The senate will decide your fate.

682
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:22,322
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

683
01:11:27,537 --> 01:11:29,997
It's treason then.

684
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:12,516
You are under arrest, my lord.

685
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:16,186
Anakin, I told you it would come to this.

686
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,938
I was right.

687
01:13:18,022 --> 01:13:20,190
The Jedi are taking over.

688
01:13:20,274 --> 01:13:22,776
The oppression of the
Sith will never return.

689
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,112
You have lost.

690
01:13:25,196 --> 01:13:27,197
No.

691
01:13:27,281 --> 01:13:30,909
No. No. You will die!

692
01:13:32,954 --> 01:13:35,539
He's a traitor!

693
01:13:35,623 --> 01:13:38,959
He is the traitor!

694
01:13:40,545 --> 01:13:45,173
I have the power to save the one you love.

695
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:48,093
You must choose.

696
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:51,763
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

697
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:55,475
Don't let him kill me.

698
01:13:58,563 --> 01:14:01,314
I can't hold it any longer.

699
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:04,651
I... I... I... I can't. I... I... I'm weak.

700
01:14:04,735 --> 01:14:06,778
I'm... I'm too weak.

701
01:14:06,904 --> 01:14:08,363
Anakin.

702
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:10,949
Help me. Help me!

703
01:14:14,078 --> 01:14:17,622
I... I... I can't hold on any longer.

704
01:14:17,707 --> 01:14:20,876
I am going to end this once and for all.

705
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,919
You can't.

706
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:24,963
He must stand trial.

707
01:14:25,047 --> 01:14:28,467
He has control of the
senate and the courts.

708
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:30,802
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

709
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:34,890
I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.

710
01:14:34,974 --> 01:14:36,892
It's not the Jedi way.

711
01:14:36,976 --> 01:14:38,518
He must live.

712
01:14:40,771 --> 01:14:42,772
Please don't.

713
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:44,191
I need him.

714
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:47,486
- Please don't!
- No!

715
01:14:53,451 --> 01:14:56,244
Power!

716
01:15:01,959 --> 01:15:06,588
Unlimited power!

717
01:15:17,016 --> 01:15:19,726
What have I done?

718
01:15:28,027 --> 01:15:32,072
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

719
01:15:33,783 --> 01:15:35,909
Become my apprentice.

720
01:15:35,993 --> 01:15:41,456
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

721
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:47,087
I will do whatever you ask.

722
01:15:49,298 --> 01:15:51,716
Good.

723
01:15:53,386 --> 01:15:56,012
Just help me save Padmé's life.

724
01:15:57,932 --> 01:16:00,350
I can't live without her.

725
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:08,400
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved,

726
01:16:08,484 --> 01:16:12,195
but if we work together...

727
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,116
I know we can discover the secret.

728
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,869
I pledge myself...

729
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:24,291
to your teachings.

730
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:29,087
Good.

731
01:16:37,346 --> 01:16:41,808
The Force is strong with you.

732
01:16:41,892 --> 01:16:47,480
A powerful Sith you will become.

733
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:51,860
Henceforth you shall be known as...

734
01:16:51,944 --> 01:16:53,278
Darth...

735
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,197
Vader.

736
01:17:00,786 --> 01:17:03,830
Thank you, my master.

737
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,001
Rise.

738
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:26,102
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice,

739
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:32,442
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

740
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:36,488
When the Jedi learn what
has transpired here,

741
01:17:36,572 --> 01:17:38,573
they will kill us,

742
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:41,284
along with all the senators.

743
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:43,370
I agree.

744
01:17:43,454 --> 01:17:47,082
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

745
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:50,168
Every single Jedi,

746
01:17:50,252 --> 01:17:53,546
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi,

747
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:57,217
is now an enemy of the Republic.

748
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:00,220
I understand, Master.

749
01:18:00,304 --> 01:18:02,931
We must move quickly.

750
01:18:03,015 --> 01:18:04,974
The Jedi are relentless.

751
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:10,897
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

752
01:18:12,566 --> 01:18:16,569
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

753
01:18:17,446 --> 01:18:20,573
We will catch them off-balance.

754
01:18:21,283 --> 01:18:24,619
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

755
01:18:24,704 --> 01:18:28,707
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

756
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:33,586
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

757
01:18:33,671 --> 01:18:36,089
to save Padmé.

758
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,677
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

759
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:43,888
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

760
01:18:45,766 --> 01:18:49,060
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple,

761
01:18:49,145 --> 01:18:51,855
go to the Mustafar system.

762
01:18:51,939 --> 01:18:55,233
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

763
01:18:55,317 --> 01:18:58,778
and the other separatist leaders.

764
01:18:58,863 --> 01:19:04,784
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

765
01:19:05,995 --> 01:19:07,912
And...

766
01:19:07,997 --> 01:19:12,792
we shall have... peace.

767
01:19:56,128 --> 01:19:58,963
Sergeant, over here!

768
01:19:59,048 --> 01:20:01,132
Hurry! Follow them!

769
01:20:03,093 --> 01:20:05,678
All Red units, let's move it!

770
01:20:05,763 --> 01:20:07,680
Come on. Let's go!

771
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:23,571
Commander, contact your troops.

772
01:20:23,656 --> 01:20:25,615
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

773
01:20:25,699 --> 01:20:27,617
Very good, sir.

774
01:20:27,701 --> 01:20:29,869
By the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

775
01:20:29,954 --> 01:20:33,540
Thank you, Cody. Now let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win here.

776
01:20:33,624 --> 01:20:35,542
Hyah!
Yes, sir.

777
01:20:42,299 --> 01:20:44,384
Commander Cody,

778
01:20:44,468 --> 01:20:47,804
the time has come.

779
01:20:47,888 --> 01:20:52,141
Execute order 66.

780
01:20:52,226 --> 01:20:54,227
Yes, my lord.

781
01:20:58,691 --> 01:21:00,066
Blast him!

782
01:21:27,052 --> 01:21:28,428
Come on!

783
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:23,024
Execute order 66.

784
01:22:23,108 --> 01:22:24,776
It will be done, my lord.

785
01:23:07,569 --> 01:23:09,862
It will be done, my lord.

786
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,818
Master Skywalker, there
are too many of them.

787
01:23:48,902 --> 01:23:50,903
What are we going to do?

788
01:24:01,373 --> 01:24:05,543
The chancellor's office indicated
Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

789
01:24:05,627 --> 01:24:08,755
Don't worry. I... I'm
sure he'll be all right.

790
01:24:37,951 --> 01:24:41,037
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

791
01:24:41,121 --> 01:24:43,706
Don't worry. The situation
is under control.

792
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:47,085
I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.

793
01:24:48,796 --> 01:24:50,755
And so it is.

794
01:24:54,384 --> 01:24:57,095
Get him!

795
01:25:07,731 --> 01:25:09,649
No!

796
01:25:13,237 --> 01:25:15,822
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

797
01:25:42,683 --> 01:25:45,643
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

798
01:25:45,727 --> 01:25:47,728
Yes, sir.

799
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,238
Good-bye, Tarfful.

800
01:25:57,322 --> 01:25:59,282
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

801
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:04,036
Miss you I will.

802
01:26:41,033 --> 01:26:43,326
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

803
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:45,828
before they walk into this catastrophe.

804
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,419
Did you find Kenobi?

805
01:26:53,503 --> 01:26:55,504
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

806
01:26:55,589 --> 01:26:58,925
Start loading your men on the ships.

807
01:26:59,009 --> 01:27:01,802
Move it.

808
01:27:33,794 --> 01:27:35,836
Emergency code 913.

809
01:27:35,921 --> 01:27:37,838
I have no contact on any frequency.

810
01:27:39,883 --> 01:27:41,968
Master Kenobi.

811
01:27:42,094 --> 01:27:44,095
Repeat.
Master Kenobi.

812
01:27:44,179 --> 01:27:48,099
Senator Organa.
My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

813
01:27:48,183 --> 01:27:50,810
We have just rescued Master Yoda.

814
01:27:50,894 --> 01:27:53,229
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

815
01:27:53,313 --> 01:27:55,481
We're sending you our coordinates.

816
01:28:02,155 --> 01:28:05,116
Hush! Not so loud.

817
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,202
Are you all right? I heard there
was an attack on the Jedi temple.

818
01:28:08,328 --> 01:28:10,788
You could see the smoke from here.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

819
01:28:10,914 --> 01:28:14,458
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
What's happening?

820
01:28:14,543 --> 01:28:17,420
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

821
01:28:17,504 --> 01:28:20,089
I can't believe that.

822
01:28:20,173 --> 01:28:24,760
I saw Master Windu attempt
to assassinate the chancellor myself.

823
01:28:24,845 --> 01:28:28,347
Anakin. What are you gonna do?

824
01:28:37,024 --> 01:28:39,233
I will not betray the Republic.

825
01:28:41,194 --> 01:28:43,195
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

826
01:28:44,281 --> 01:28:47,033
and with the senate and with you.

827
01:28:47,117 --> 01:28:49,327
What about Obi-Wan?

828
01:28:49,411 --> 01:28:51,662
I don't know.

829
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:53,873
Many Jedi have been killed.

830
01:28:53,957 --> 01:28:57,793
We can only hope that he's remained
loyal to the chancellor.

831
01:28:57,878 --> 01:29:00,254
Anakin, I'm afraid.

832
01:29:02,174 --> 01:29:05,301
Have faith, my love.

833
01:29:05,385 --> 01:29:07,720
Everything will soon be set right.

834
01:29:07,804 --> 01:29:11,223
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

835
01:29:11,308 --> 01:29:14,518
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

836
01:29:14,603 --> 01:29:17,146
I'm going there to end this war.

837
01:29:17,230 --> 01:29:19,148
Wait for me until I return.

838
01:29:19,232 --> 01:29:21,650
Things will be different. I promise.

839
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:29,450
Please, wait for me.

840
01:29:33,497 --> 01:29:36,248
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

841
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,419
Take care, my little friend.

842
01:29:44,674 --> 01:29:48,386
My lady, is there anything I might do?

843
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:51,013
No, thank you, 3 PO.

844
01:29:51,098 --> 01:29:55,851
I... I feel so helpless.

845
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:22,044
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

846
01:30:22,129 --> 01:30:25,464
Heard from no one have we.

847
01:30:25,549 --> 01:30:28,676
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

848
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:30,678
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

849
01:30:30,762 --> 01:30:33,347
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

850
01:30:33,432 --> 01:30:36,308
Received a coded retreat message we have.

851
01:30:36,393 --> 01:30:40,396
It requests all Jedi to
return to the temple.

852
01:30:40,522 --> 01:30:43,983
It says the war is over.
Well, then we must go back.

853
01:30:44,067 --> 01:30:47,570
If there are any stragglers,
they will fall into the trap and be killed.

854
01:30:47,654 --> 01:30:52,533
Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

855
01:30:52,617 --> 01:30:55,369
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

856
01:30:55,454 --> 01:30:58,038
I agree.

857
01:30:58,123 --> 01:31:01,750
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

858
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:26,150
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

859
01:31:26,234 --> 01:31:29,028
You have done well, Viceroy.

860
01:31:29,112 --> 01:31:34,950
When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives,

861
01:31:35,035 --> 01:31:38,579
he will take care of you.

862
01:31:50,175 --> 01:31:53,260
We're receiving a message
from the chancellor's office, sir.

863
01:31:53,386 --> 01:31:55,387
Send it through.
Yes, sir.

864
01:31:57,098 --> 01:32:01,810
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

865
01:32:01,895 --> 01:32:03,896
at a special session of Congress.

866
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:07,566
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

867
01:32:10,529 --> 01:32:13,822
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

868
01:32:13,907 --> 01:32:17,034
The chancellor will not be able to control
the thousands of star systems...

869
01:32:17,118 --> 01:32:19,078
without keeping the senate intact.

870
01:32:19,996 --> 01:32:23,207
If a special session of Congress there is,

871
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:26,961
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

872
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:07,084
R2, stay with the ship.

873
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:35,529
Welcome, Lord Vader. We've
been expecting you.

874
01:34:07,354 --> 01:34:11,857
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

875
01:34:11,983 --> 01:34:14,276
What's happened?
The chancellor's been elaborating...

876
01:34:14,361 --> 01:34:17,696
on a plot by the Jedi
to overthrow the senate.

877
01:34:17,781 --> 01:34:23,285
The remaining Jedi
will be hunted down and defeated.

878
01:34:39,052 --> 01:34:41,553
Not even the younglings survived.

879
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:44,598
Killed not by clones...

880
01:34:44,683 --> 01:34:47,935
this Padawan.

881
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:51,689
By a lightsaber he was.

882
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:02,116
Who? Who could have done this?

883
01:35:12,794 --> 01:35:16,004
The attempt on my life...

884
01:35:16,089 --> 01:35:18,757
has left me scarred...

885
01:35:18,842 --> 01:35:21,844
and deformed.

886
01:35:21,928 --> 01:35:24,847
But I assure you.

887
01:35:24,931 --> 01:35:29,685
My resolve has never been stronger!

888
01:35:33,857 --> 01:35:37,735
Stop! No!

889
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:51,039
In order to ensure the security...

890
01:35:51,124 --> 01:35:53,709
and continuing stability,

891
01:35:53,793 --> 01:35:57,713
the Republic will be reorganized...

892
01:35:57,797 --> 01:36:03,260
into the first Galactic Empire!

893
01:36:03,344 --> 01:36:05,387
For a safe...

894
01:36:05,472 --> 01:36:10,058
and secure society.

895
01:36:19,444 --> 01:36:22,154
So this is how liberty dies.

896
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:24,990
With thunderous applause.

897
01:36:27,368 --> 01:36:29,578
The war is over.

898
01:36:29,662 --> 01:36:33,791
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-

899
01:36:41,925 --> 01:36:46,637
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

900
01:36:46,721 --> 01:36:49,181
For the clones...

901
01:36:49,265 --> 01:36:53,393
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

902
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:07,783
Wait. Master.

903
01:37:07,867 --> 01:37:11,078
There is something I must know.

904
01:37:17,168 --> 01:37:19,628
If into the security recordings you go,

905
01:37:19,712 --> 01:37:21,630
only pain will you find.

906
01:37:21,714 --> 01:37:25,217
I must know the truth, Master.

907
01:37:32,058 --> 01:37:36,019
It can't be.

908
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:40,190
You have done well, my new apprentice.

909
01:37:40,275 --> 01:37:43,318
Now, Lord Vader,

910
01:37:43,403 --> 01:37:46,947
go and bring peace to the Empire.

911
01:37:47,031 --> 01:37:49,199
I can't watch any more.

912
01:37:49,284 --> 01:37:53,912
Destroy the Sith we must.

913
01:37:55,665 --> 01:37:57,791
Send me to kill the emperor.

914
01:37:57,876 --> 01:38:00,168
I will not kill Anakin.

915
01:38:00,253 --> 01:38:05,007
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

916
01:38:05,091 --> 01:38:08,343
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

917
01:38:08,428 --> 01:38:14,182
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

918
01:38:14,267 --> 01:38:17,686
The boy you trained, gone he is.

919
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:20,689
Consumed by Darth Vader.

920
01:38:20,773 --> 01:38:23,817
I do not know where the
emperor has sent him.

921
01:38:23,902 --> 01:38:26,153
I don't know where to look.

922
01:38:27,447 --> 01:38:31,158
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

923
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:44,254
When was the last time you saw him?

924
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:47,799
Yesterday.
And do you know where he is now?

925
01:38:48,843 --> 01:38:50,844
No.

926
01:38:50,929 --> 01:38:54,514
Padmé, I need your help.

927
01:38:54,641 --> 01:38:57,643
He is in grave danger.
From the Sith?

928
01:38:57,727 --> 01:38:59,728
From himself.

929
01:39:02,148 --> 01:39:04,232
Padmé,

930
01:39:04,317 --> 01:39:06,735
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

931
01:39:06,819 --> 01:39:10,322
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

932
01:39:13,076 --> 01:39:16,912
I have seen a... a security hologram...

933
01:39:16,996 --> 01:39:19,456
of him...

934
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:21,458
killing younglings.

935
01:39:21,542 --> 01:39:24,586
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

936
01:39:24,671 --> 01:39:27,673
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

937
01:39:27,757 --> 01:39:32,302
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

938
01:39:34,097 --> 01:39:36,848
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

939
01:39:36,933 --> 01:39:41,061
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

940
01:39:47,235 --> 01:39:49,236
I don't believe you.

941
01:39:50,613 --> 01:39:52,614
I can't.

942
01:39:57,704 --> 01:39:58,870
Padmé,

943
01:40:00,289 --> 01:40:02,582
I must find him.

944
01:40:05,044 --> 01:40:07,045
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

945
01:40:10,717 --> 01:40:13,218
He has become a very great threat.

946
01:40:15,805 --> 01:40:17,806
I can't.

947
01:40:30,987 --> 01:40:32,946
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

948
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:38,910
I'm so sorry.

949
01:41:25,124 --> 01:41:26,625
Milady, let me come with you.

950
01:41:26,709 --> 01:41:29,669
There's no danger.
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

951
01:41:29,754 --> 01:41:32,172
As you wish, milady, but
I strongly disagree.

952
01:41:32,256 --> 01:41:35,926
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

953
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:38,428
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

954
01:41:40,264 --> 01:41:42,265
Dear.

955
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,986
Do you know?

956
01:41:55,071 --> 01:41:58,698
I think I'm beginning to get the hang
of this flying business.

957
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:29,521
The separatists
have been taken care of, my master.

958
01:42:29,605 --> 01:42:32,524
It is finished then.

959
01:42:33,901 --> 01:42:39,739
You have restored
peace and justice to the galaxy.

960
01:42:39,824 --> 01:42:44,744
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

961
01:42:44,829 --> 01:42:50,000
All droid units
must shut down immediately.

962
01:42:50,084 --> 01:42:52,210
Very good, my lord.

963
01:43:52,104 --> 01:43:54,231
I saw your ship.

964
01:43:57,026 --> 01:44:00,070
What are you doing out here?
I was so worried about you.

965
01:44:01,489 --> 01:44:04,366
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

966
01:44:04,450 --> 01:44:06,618
What things?

967
01:44:06,702 --> 01:44:09,663
He said you've turned to the dark side.

968
01:44:09,747 --> 01:44:12,165
That you...

969
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,417
killed younglings.

970
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,588
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

971
01:44:18,714 --> 01:44:22,509
He cares about us.
Us?

972
01:44:22,593 --> 01:44:25,345
He knows.

973
01:44:25,429 --> 01:44:27,347
He wants to help you.

974
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:34,437
Anakin, all I want is your love.

975
01:44:34,522 --> 01:44:36,856
Love won't save you, Padmé.

976
01:44:36,983 --> 01:44:40,235
Only my new powers can do that.
At what cost?

977
01:44:40,319 --> 01:44:42,737
You're a good person. Don't do this.

978
01:44:42,822 --> 01:44:45,573
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

979
01:44:45,658 --> 01:44:49,911
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

980
01:44:49,996 --> 01:44:52,831
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

981
01:44:54,625 --> 01:44:56,084
Come away with me.

982
01:44:56,168 --> 01:44:58,837
Help me raise our child.

983
01:44:58,963 --> 01:45:03,216
Leave everything else behind while
we still can. Don't you see?

984
01:45:03,301 --> 01:45:06,553
We don't have to run away anymore.

985
01:45:06,637 --> 01:45:09,180
I have brought peace to the Republic.

986
01:45:09,265 --> 01:45:12,142
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

987
01:45:12,226 --> 01:45:14,352
I... I can overthrow him.

988
01:45:16,397 --> 01:45:19,482
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy,

989
01:45:19,567 --> 01:45:22,027
make things the way we want them to be.

990
01:45:28,326 --> 01:45:30,368
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

991
01:45:31,829 --> 01:45:35,165
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

992
01:45:37,335 --> 01:45:40,211
I don't want to hear any
more about Obi-Wan.

993
01:45:40,296 --> 01:45:44,507
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

994
01:45:46,177 --> 01:45:48,219
I don't know you anymore.

995
01:45:49,805 --> 01:45:51,806
Anakin,

996
01:45:51,891 --> 01:45:54,476
you're breaking my heart.

997
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:57,562
You're going down a path I can't follow.

998
01:45:57,646 --> 01:46:00,440
Because of Obi-Wan?

999
01:46:00,524 --> 01:46:03,318
Because of what you've done.

1000
01:46:03,402 --> 01:46:05,362
What you plan to do.

1001
01:46:06,572 --> 01:46:09,240
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

1002
01:46:09,325 --> 01:46:12,285
I love you.
Liar!

1003
01:46:15,122 --> 01:46:16,998
No.

1004
01:46:17,083 --> 01:46:20,835
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

1005
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,922
- No.
- Let her go, Anakin.

1006
01:46:25,424 --> 01:46:27,008
Anakin.

1007
01:46:27,093 --> 01:46:29,302
Let her go.

1008
01:46:39,271 --> 01:46:41,314
You turned her against me!

1009
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:45,110
You have done that yourself.

1010
01:46:49,824 --> 01:46:52,033
You will not take her from me!

1011
01:46:52,118 --> 01:46:55,995
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

1012
01:46:59,125 --> 01:47:04,295
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind, until now...

1013
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,050
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

1014
01:47:09,135 --> 01:47:11,052
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

1015
01:47:11,137 --> 01:47:13,680
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

1016
01:47:14,765 --> 01:47:17,183
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1017
01:47:18,978 --> 01:47:20,937
I have brought peace,

1018
01:47:21,021 --> 01:47:22,730
freedom, justice...

1019
01:47:22,815 --> 01:47:26,693
and security to my new empire.

1020
01:47:26,777 --> 01:47:29,654
Your new empire?

1021
01:47:29,738 --> 01:47:33,074
Don't make me kill you.

1022
01:47:33,159 --> 01:47:37,704
Anakin, my allegiance
is to the Republic, to democracy!

1023
01:47:37,788 --> 01:47:40,415
If you're not with me,

1024
01:47:41,417 --> 01:47:43,334
then you're my enemy.

1025
01:47:45,337 --> 01:47:47,839
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1026
01:47:50,426 --> 01:47:51,885
I will do what I must.

1027
01:47:52,928 --> 01:47:55,346
You will try.

1028
01:48:27,087 --> 01:48:31,132
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1029
01:48:31,217 --> 01:48:35,720
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1030
01:48:35,804 --> 01:48:38,056
Master Yoda.

1031
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,225
You survived.

1032
01:48:40,309 --> 01:48:43,061
Surprised?

1033
01:48:43,145 --> 01:48:47,774
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1034
01:48:47,858 --> 01:48:49,943
Now you will experience...

1035
01:48:50,027 --> 01:48:54,531
the full power of the dark side.

1036
01:49:36,448 --> 01:49:40,159
I have waited a long time...

1037
01:49:40,244 --> 01:49:42,829
for this moment,

1038
01:49:42,913 --> 01:49:47,458
my little green friend.

1039
01:49:56,468 --> 01:50:01,139
At last the Jedi are no more.

1040
01:50:01,223 --> 01:50:05,476
Not if anything
to say about it I have.

1041
01:50:10,065 --> 01:50:13,151
At an end your rule is.

1042
01:50:14,987 --> 01:50:17,447
And not short enough it was.

1043
01:50:22,244 --> 01:50:24,454
If so powerful you are,

1044
01:50:25,664 --> 01:50:26,956
why leave?

1045
01:50:28,083 --> 01:50:30,668
You will not stop me.

1046
01:50:30,753 --> 01:50:35,381
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1047
01:50:35,466 --> 01:50:39,844
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1048
01:50:41,138 --> 01:50:45,224
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1049
01:55:12,826 --> 01:55:15,578
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1050
01:55:15,662 --> 01:55:18,497
Activate your homing
beacon when you're ready.

1051
01:55:18,582 --> 01:55:20,958
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1052
01:55:21,043 --> 01:55:24,712
Then he is not dead.
Double your search.

1053
01:55:24,796 --> 01:55:27,048
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1054
01:55:27,132 --> 01:55:32,219
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1055
01:55:32,346 --> 01:55:37,475
Yes, Master.
I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1056
01:56:46,253 --> 01:56:50,047
Into exile I must go.

1057
01:56:50,132 --> 01:56:52,258
Failed I have.

1058
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:33,609
I have failed you, Anakin.

1059
01:58:33,693 --> 01:58:35,611
I have failed you.

1060
01:58:35,695 --> 01:58:38,614
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1061
01:58:38,698 --> 01:58:41,534
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1062
01:58:41,618 --> 01:58:44,286
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

1063
01:58:44,371 --> 01:58:45,996
Well, then you are lost!

1064
01:58:57,843 --> 01:59:00,386
This is the end for you, my master.

1065
01:59:24,870 --> 01:59:29,039
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1066
01:59:30,667 --> 01:59:33,377
You underestimate my power.

1067
01:59:34,713 --> 01:59:35,880
Don't try it.

1068
01:59:58,820 --> 02:00:00,738
You were the chosen one!

1069
02:00:02,199 --> 02:00:05,659
It was said that you would
destroy the Sith, not join them!

1070
02:00:08,038 --> 02:00:10,122
Bring balance to the Force,

1071
02:00:10,207 --> 02:00:12,750
not leave it in darkness!

1072
02:00:23,511 --> 02:00:25,471
I hate you!

1073
02:00:33,438 --> 02:00:35,606
You were my brother, Anakin.

1074
02:00:37,609 --> 02:00:39,985
I loved you.

1075
02:01:19,818 --> 02:01:21,819
Master Kenobi.

1076
02:01:21,903 --> 02:01:24,196
Um, we have Miss Padmé on board.

1077
02:01:24,281 --> 02:01:26,824
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1078
02:01:26,908 --> 02:01:29,118
We should leave this dreadful place.

1079
02:01:41,131 --> 02:01:43,132
Obi-Wan.

1080
02:01:44,634 --> 02:01:46,844
Is Anakin all right?

1081
02:02:55,413 --> 02:02:58,248
Your Majesty, this way.

1082
02:02:58,333 --> 02:03:00,250
There he is.

1083
02:03:00,335 --> 02:03:02,544
He's still alive.

1084
02:03:05,507 --> 02:03:07,758
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1085
02:03:07,842 --> 02:03:09,843
Yes, sir. Right away.

1086
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:47,756
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1087
02:03:53,638 --> 02:03:55,848
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1088
02:04:12,657 --> 02:04:15,117
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1089
02:04:44,647 --> 02:04:47,649
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1090
02:04:47,734 --> 02:04:50,986
For reasons we can't
explain, we are losing her.

1091
02:04:52,322 --> 02:04:55,073
She's dying?
We don't know why.

1092
02:04:55,158 --> 02:04:57,242
She has lost the will to live.

1093
02:04:57,327 --> 02:05:00,496
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1094
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:02,206
Babies?

1095
02:05:02,290 --> 02:05:04,208
She's carrying twins.

1096
02:05:43,790 --> 02:05:46,250
Ee-see-tah oy-doh.

1097
02:05:46,334 --> 02:05:49,127
Luke.

1098
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:59,596
Luke.

1099
02:06:03,101 --> 02:06:07,354
Ooh-bah, ooh-bah.

1100
02:06:07,480 --> 02:06:10,899
Ooh-bah.

1101
02:06:16,906 --> 02:06:19,825
Ee-see-tah oy-dah.

1102
02:06:19,951 --> 02:06:22,911
It's a girl.
Leia.

1103
02:07:04,871 --> 02:07:06,288
Obi-Wan?

1104
02:07:11,753 --> 02:07:13,670
There's good in him.

1105
02:07:16,341 --> 02:07:18,300
I know.

1106
02:07:18,384 --> 02:07:21,011
I know there's...

1107
02:07:21,095 --> 02:07:23,096
still-

1108
02:07:57,256 --> 02:07:59,966
Lord Vader.

1109
02:08:00,051 --> 02:08:02,177
Can you hear me?

1110
02:08:05,223 --> 02:08:07,724
Yes, Master.

1111
02:08:09,811 --> 02:08:12,646
Where is Padmé?

1112
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:15,440
Is she safe?

1113
02:08:16,526 --> 02:08:18,568
Is she all right?

1114
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:24,825
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1115
02:08:25,827 --> 02:08:28,745
I? I couldn't have.

1116
02:08:28,830 --> 02:08:31,873
She was alive. I felt it!

1117
02:08:51,602 --> 02:08:55,939
No!

1118
02:09:05,783 --> 02:09:09,578
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1119
02:09:11,205 --> 02:09:14,791
We must take them somewhere where the
Sith will not sense their presence.

1120
02:09:15,877 --> 02:09:19,838
Split up they should be.

1121
02:09:19,922 --> 02:09:22,090
My wife and I will take the girl.

1122
02:09:23,634 --> 02:09:26,970
We've always talked of
adopting a baby girl.

1123
02:09:27,054 --> 02:09:28,930
She will be loved with us.

1124
02:09:30,183 --> 02:09:31,808
And what of the boy?

1125
02:09:32,810 --> 02:09:36,271
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1126
02:09:38,065 --> 02:09:40,525
I will take the child and watch over him.

1127
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:49,659
Until the time is right, disappear we will.

1128
02:09:51,454 --> 02:09:55,081
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1129
02:09:56,584 --> 02:10:01,838
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1130
02:10:03,216 --> 02:10:04,466
Training?

1131
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:09,179
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1132
02:10:11,182 --> 02:10:14,309
One who has returned
from the netherworld of the Force.

1133
02:10:14,393 --> 02:10:16,937
Your old master.

1134
02:10:17,021 --> 02:10:19,022
Qui-Gon?

1135
02:10:21,526 --> 02:10:24,820
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1136
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:28,448
Captain Antilles.
Yes, Your Highness?

1137
02:10:28,533 --> 02:10:30,450
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1138
02:10:30,535 --> 02:10:32,452
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1139
02:10:32,537 --> 02:10:34,412
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1140
02:10:34,539 --> 02:10:36,039
What?

1141
02:10:37,875 --> 02:10:39,876
No.
