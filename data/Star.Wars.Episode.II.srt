1
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,972
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,307
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,945
We made it.

4
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,991
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,411
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,973
Cordé.

7
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,102
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,480
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,565
No.

10
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:58,404
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:07,997
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,751
You did your duty. Cordé did hers.
Now, come.

13
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:15,838
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,061
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,981
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:37,777
- If they do break away...
- I will not let this Republic

17
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,489
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.

18
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,825
My negotiations will not fail.

19
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,035
If they do,

20
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:49,455
you must realize there aren't enough
Jedi to protect the Republic.

21
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,958
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

22
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:57,087
Master Yoda.

23
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,007
Do you think it will really come to war?

24
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:05,721
The dark side clouds everything.

25
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:10,601
Impossible to see the future is.

26
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,856
The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honor.

27
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,191
Good.

28
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:21,654
Send them in.

29
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,448
We will discuss this matter later.

30
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,748
Senator Amidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform,

31
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,792
terrible.

32
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,546
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.

33
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,423
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

34
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:46,220
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

35
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,056
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

36
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,060
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

37
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:56,021
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

38
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,775
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

39
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,361
But for certain, Senator,

40
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:07,324
in grave danger you are.

41
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,452
Master Jedi, may I suggest

42
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,665
the senator be placed
under the protection of your graces.

43
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:17,918
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

44
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,129
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

45
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,840
The situation is that serious?

46
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:25,175
No, but I do, Senator.

47
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,512
I realize all too well
that additional security

48
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,848
might be disruptive for you,

49
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:34,935
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

50
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:39,106
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

51
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,317
That's possible.

52
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,194
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

53
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,531
Do it for me, milady. Please?

54
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,159
The thought of losing you...

55
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,829
Is unbearable.

56
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:57,958
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

57
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,419
Thank you, Master Windu.

58
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,680
You seem a little on edge.

59
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,223
Not at all.

60
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,352
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

61
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,438
You fell into
that nightmare, Master,

62
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,149
and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,943
Oh.

64
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:26,320
Yes.

65
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,286
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

66
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,289
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

67
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:54,723
Obi? Obi!

68
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,059
Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!

69
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,769
Good to see you again, Jar Jar.

70
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:00,646
Senator Padmé.

71
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,274
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

72
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,027
Desa Jedi arriven.

73
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,826
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

74
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:16,328
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.

75
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,083
Ani? My goodness, you've grown.

76
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:25,212
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

77
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,840
Well, for a senator, I mean.

78
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,345
Ani, you'll always be
that little boy I knew on Tatooine.

79
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,267
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

80
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,769
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

81
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,313
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

82
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,190
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

83
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,193
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

84
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,113
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

85
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,365
I want to know who's trying to kill me.

86
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:57,161
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.

87
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:59,913
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

88
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,373
I promise you.

89
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,626
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

90
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,671
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

91
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,215
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin,

92
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,052
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?

93
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,511
What?

94
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,223
Why else do you think
we were assigned to her

95
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,184
if not to find the killer?

96
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:23,353
Protection is a job for local security,
not Jedi.

97
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,482
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

98
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:29,943
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

99
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:35,282
And you will learn your place,
young one.

100
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,788
Perhaps with merely your presence

101
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,957
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

102
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,585
Now, if you'll excuse me,

103
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:48,670
I will retire.

104
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,965
I know I'll feel better having you here.

105
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,675
I'll have an officer
stationed on every floor,

106
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,637
and I'll be in the
control center downstairs.

107
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,225
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

108
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:04,353
She hardly even recognized me,
Jar Jar.

109
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:10,067
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...

110
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,236
She's forgotten me completely.

111
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:16,406
Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
seein her in a longo time.

112
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,161
You're focusing on the negative,
Anakin. Be mindful of your thoughts.

113
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,080
She was pleased to see us.

114
00:10:23,163 --> 00:10:25,624
Now, let's check the security.

115
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,260
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

116
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:38,804
We'll have to try
something more subtle this time, Zam.

117
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,973
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.

118
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,934
Be careful. They're very poisonous.

119
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:47,896
Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

120
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,068
Captain Typho has more
than enough men downstairs.

121
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,279
No assassin would try that way.

122
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:58,365
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

123
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,034
I don't like just waiting here

124
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,828
for something to happen to her.

125
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,371
What's going on?

126
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:07,249
She covered the cameras.

127
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,168
I don't think she liked me watching her.

128
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,711
What is she thinking?

129
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:14,298
She programmed R2
to warn us if there is an intruder.

130
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:17,009
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

131
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:21,471
I know, but we also want to
catch this assassin, don't we, Master?

132
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,601
You're using her as bait.

133
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,936
It was her idea.

134
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,314
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.

135
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:33,817
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

136
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,527
Trust me.

137
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,155
It's too risky.

138
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:41,950
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

139
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,119
And yours are?

140
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,165
Possibly.

141
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,555
You look tired.

142
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,142
I don't sleep well anymore.

143
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:09,728
Because of your mother?

144
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,694
I don't know why
I keep dreaming about her.

145
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,532
Dreams pass in time.

146
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,453
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

147
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,457
Just being around her again
is intoxicating.

148
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,502
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

149
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:35,420
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order,

150
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,673
a commitment not easily broken.

151
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,926
And don't forget, she's a politician,
and they're not to be trusted.

152
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,470
She's not like the others
in the Senate, Master.

153
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:45,222
It is my experience
that senators

154
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:49,351
focus only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns,

155
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:52,562
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy

156
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,399
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

157
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:58,986
At least not on the
economics of politics.

158
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,626
And besides, you're generalizing.

159
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,171
The chancellor
doesn't appear to be corrupt.

160
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:00,589
Palpatine is a politician.

161
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,008
I have observed that he is very clever

162
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:07,637
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

163
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,514
I think he's a good man. My...

164
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,641
I sense it too.

165
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:29,743
Stay here!

166
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,040
Are you all right, milady?

167
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,992
What the...

168
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,650
- What took you so long?
- You know, Master.

169
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,611
I couldn't find a speeder
that I really liked.

170
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:28,737
There he is.

171
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,698
With the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

172
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:33,783
If you spent as much time practicing
your saber techniques

173
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,661
as you do your wit, you would rival
Master Yoda as a swordsman.

174
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,163
I thought I already did.

175
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,832
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

176
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,780
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

177
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,830
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

178
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:21,957
Sorry, Master.

179
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,543
I forgot you don't like flying.

180
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,462
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide.

181
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,868
Anakin!
How many times have I told you...

182
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,870
Stay away from power couplings!

183
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:04,958
That was good!

184
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:22,726
Where are you going?
He went that way.

185
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,936
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer,

186
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,063
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried,

187
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,065
and, personally,
I'd very much like to find out

188
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,568
who he is and who he's working for.

189
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:34,529
This is a shortcut. I think.

190
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:04,517
Well, you've lost him.

191
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,603
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

192
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:08,605
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

193
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,774
He went completely the other way.

194
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,443
- Once again you've proved...
- If you'll excuse me.

195
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,656
I hate it when he does that.

196
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:48,973
Anakin!

197
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:52,393
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

198
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,395
Use the Force. Think.

199
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,315
- Sorry, Master.
- He went in there to hide, not to run.

200
00:21:57,398 --> 00:22:00,860
- Yes, Master.
- Next time, try not to lose it.

201
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,363
- Yes, Master.
- This weapon is your life.

202
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:05,865
I try, Master.

203
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,368
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

204
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:10,328
Don't say that, Master.

205
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:12,497
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

206
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,084
- Then why don't you listen to me?
- I am trying.

207
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,267
- Can you see him?
- I think he is a she,

208
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,185
and I think she is a changeling.

209
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,147
In that case, be extra careful.

210
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:42,819
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

211
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,279
For a drink.

212
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:56,416
Thank you.

213
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,252
You wanna buy some death sticks?

214
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:01,129
You don't want to sell me death sticks.

215
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,964
I don't want to sell you death sticks.

216
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,507
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

217
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,176
I want to go home and rethink my life.

218
00:23:55,934 --> 00:24:00,313
Easy. Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

219
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,279
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

220
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,907
It was a senator from Naboo.

221
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,909
And who hired you?

222
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:13,993
It was just a job.

223
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,205
Who hired you? Tell us.

224
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:20,833
Tell us now!

225
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,461
It was a bounty hunter called...

226
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,691
Toxic dart.

227
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:59,163
Track down
this bounty hunter you must, Obi-Wan.

228
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,792
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

229
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,502
What about Senator Amidala?

230
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:06,879
She will still need protecting.

231
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,341
Handle that your Padawan will.

232
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:15,138
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

233
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:19,058
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

234
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,269
Travel as refugees.

235
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:23,771
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult

236
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,607
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

237
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:30,319
Until caught this killer is,

238
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,781
our judgment she must respect.

239
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,242
Anakin, go to the Senate

240
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:39,328
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

241
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:53,342
I will talk with her. Senator Amidala
will not refuse an executive order.

242
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,803
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

243
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:58,097
Thank you, Your Excellency.

244
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:02,310
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

245
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,479
Your patience has paid off.

246
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:08,149
Your guidance more than my patience.

247
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:11,319
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

248
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:15,073
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

249
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:18,868
Then you will be invincible.

250
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,123
I have said it many times.

251
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,959
You are the most
gifted Jedi I have ever met.

252
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,377
Thank you, Your Excellency.

253
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:32,173
I see you becoming
the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin,

254
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,176
even more powerful than Master Yoda.

255
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,266
I am concerned for my Padawan.

256
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,103
He is not ready to be
given this assignment on his own yet.

257
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,189
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

258
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:50,233
The boy has exceptional skills.

259
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:53,027
But he still has much to learn, Master.

260
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,572
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

261
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,699
Yes, yes.

262
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,911
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

263
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:03,454
Hmm.

264
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,415
Too sure of themselves they are.

265
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,919
Even the older, more experienced ones.

266
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,506
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true,

267
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:14,924
your apprentice is the only one

268
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:17,468
who can bring the Force
back into balance.

269
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,142
I'm taking an extended leave
of absence.

270
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,436
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the Senate.

271
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,313
- Representative Binks...
- Hmm?

272
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,439
I know I can count on you.

273
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:35,361
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

274
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:39,740
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and...

275
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,827
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

276
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,412
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

277
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,832
Of course. Milady.

278
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,839
I do not like this idea of hiding.

279
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,841
Don't worry.

280
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:58,968
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation,

281
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:01,679
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

282
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:04,849
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act

283
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:07,268
to not be here when its fate is decided.

284
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:11,314
Sometimes we must let go of our pride
and do what is requested of us.

285
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:14,942
Anakin, you've grown up.

286
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,447
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

287
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:30,416
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

288
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:35,296
As wise as Master Yoda
and as powerful as Master Windu.

289
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,092
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

290
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,848
In some ways, a lot of ways,

291
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:49,143
I'm really ahead of him.

292
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:51,812
I'm ready for the trials,

293
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,524
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

294
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,568
He won't let me move on.

295
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,404
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

296
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,324
He's overly critical. He never listens.

297
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:05,534
He doesn't understand.

298
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,162
It's not fair!

299
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:13,167
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

300
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,253
It's the only way we grow.

301
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,590
I know.

302
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,176
Anakin.

303
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:26,430
Don't try to grow up too fast.

304
00:29:26,889 --> 00:29:29,016
But I am grown up.

305
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,979
You said it yourself.

306
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:36,065
Please don't look at me like that.

307
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,611
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.

308
00:29:42,863 --> 00:29:44,865
Sorry, milady.

309
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,675
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

310
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,845
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

311
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,264
He'll be safe with me.

312
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,563
- You'll be fine.
- It's not me, milady.

313
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:19,734
I worry about you. What if they realize
you've left the capital?

314
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:24,363
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

315
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,073
Anakin.

316
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,535
Don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

317
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,787
Yes, Master.

318
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:35,416
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

319
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,251
You'll be back here in no time.

320
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,629
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

321
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,548
- It's time to go.
- I know.

322
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,301
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

323
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:47,636
May the Force be with you, Master.

324
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,608
Suddenly I'm afraid.

325
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:04,487
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

326
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,366
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

327
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,625
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

328
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:21,587
I'd be more concerned
about her doing something than him.

329
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:44,568
Someone to see ya, honey!

330
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,612
Jedi, by the looks of him.

331
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:51,992
- Obi-Wan!
- Hello, Dex.

332
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:54,745
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

333
00:31:57,164 --> 00:32:00,626
<i>- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.</i>

334
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,258
Hey, old buddy!

335
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:19,520
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

336
00:32:19,603 --> 00:32:21,272
You can tell me what this is.

337
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,568
Well, whattaya know!

338
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,487
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'

339
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,241
on Subterrel, beyond the Outer Rim.

340
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:34,160
Can you tell me where it came from?
Thank you.

341
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,413
This baby belongs to them cloners.

342
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:41,667
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

343
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,837
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

344
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,923
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

345
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,719
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

346
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:54,555
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect

347
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:55,890
for the difference
between knowledge and...

348
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,852
Wisdom.

349
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:03,814
Well, if droids could think, there'd be
none of us here, would there?

350
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:07,276
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

351
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,278
No, no. It's beyond the Outer Rim.

352
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:14,575
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

353
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:18,871
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

354
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,960
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.

355
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,255
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

356
00:33:29,256 --> 00:33:33,219
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

357
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,887
Depends on what, Dex?

358
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:37,765
On how good your manners are...

359
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:42,853
And how big your pocketbook is.

360
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,490
Did you call for assistance?

361
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:55,616
Yes, yes, I did.

362
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,910
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

363
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:00,996
Yes, I'm looking for
a planetary system called Kamino.

364
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,081
Kamino.

365
00:34:02,164 --> 00:34:03,624
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

366
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:07,753
Kamino.
It's not a system I'm familiar with.

367
00:34:07,836 --> 00:34:10,714
Are you sure you
have the right coordinates?

368
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,592
According to my information,
it should appear in this quadrant here,

369
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,844
just south of the Rishi Maze.

370
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:26,146
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for

371
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,773
doesn't exist.

372
00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:31,610
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

373
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:34,863
If an item does not appear
in our records,

374
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,491
it does not exist.

375
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,973
Hey, you! No droids!

376
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,808
Get outta here!

377
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,567
Thank you, R2.

378
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:15,487
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi,

379
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,698
not being able
to visit the places you like

380
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:19,742
or do the things you like.

381
00:35:19,825 --> 00:35:21,994
Or be with the people that I love.

382
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:24,788
Are you allowed to love?

383
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,832
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

384
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,838
Attachment is forbidden.

385
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,924
Possession is forbidden.

386
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,887
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love,

387
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,473
is central to a Jedi's life.

388
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,438
So you might say
that we are encouraged to love.

389
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:54,068
- You've changed so much.
- You haven't changed a bit.

390
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:57,029
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

391
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:13,253
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

392
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:17,007
Use your feelings you must.

393
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,555
Younglings. Younglings!

394
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,225
A visitor we have.

395
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,186
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

396
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,398
Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

397
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,110
What help can I be, Obi-Wan, hmm?

398
00:36:36,276 --> 00:36:39,113
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

399
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,408
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

400
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:43,909
Hmm.

401
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:46,704
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

402
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:51,208
How embarrassing.

403
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,253
Liam, the shades.

404
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:57,131
Gather round the map reader.

405
00:36:57,923 --> 00:36:59,383
Clear your minds

406
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:03,929
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

407
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,600
It ought to be here,

408
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,060
but it isn't.

409
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,022
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

410
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,274
Hmm.

411
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:17,651
Gravity's silhouette remains,

412
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,362
but the star and all the planets,

413
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,781
disappeared they have.

414
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,825
How can this be?

415
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:28,120
A thought?

416
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:32,499
- Anyone.
- Master?

417
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,544
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

418
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:43,635
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

419
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:48,098
The Padawan is right.

420
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,059
Go to the center of gravity's pull

421
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:55,147
and find your planet you will.

422
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:03,447
The data must have been erased.

423
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,658
But, Master Yoda, who could empty
information from the archives?

424
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,243
That's impossible, isn't it?

425
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,872
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

426
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:15,876
Only a Jedi could
have erased those files.

427
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:19,838
But who and why, harder to answer.

428
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:24,051
Meditate on this I will.

429
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:50,661
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected,

430
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:54,498
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

431
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,291
I'm not sure I was ready.

432
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,837
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

433
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,672
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution

434
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:03,715
So you could stay in office.

435
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,552
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

436
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:09,930
But when the queen
asked me to serve as senator,

437
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:12,432
I couldn't refuse her.

438
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,270
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

439
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:20,190
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

440
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,574
If the Senate
votes to create an army,

441
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,659
I'm sure it's going
to push us into a civil war.

442
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:32,995
It's unthinkable.

443
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:36,290
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

444
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,042
Do you see any way
through negotiations

445
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,086
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

446
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:43,046
Not if they feel threatened.

447
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,257
My guess is they'll turn
to the Trade Federations

448
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,758
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

449
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:51,179
It's outrageous, but after four trials
in the Supreme Court,

450
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:55,183
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

451
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:59,313
I fear the Senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

452
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,650
We must keep our faith in the Republic.

453
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:14,620
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

454
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,080
Let's pray that day never comes.

455
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,083
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

456
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:23,211
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

457
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,172
Oh, Anakin's not a Jedi yet.

458
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:27,299
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking...

459
00:40:27,382 --> 00:40:30,010
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.

460
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:32,429
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

461
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,640
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

462
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,310
Excuse me.
I'm in charge of security here, milady.

463
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,437
And this is my home.
I know it very well.

464
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,897
That is why we're here.

465
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,649
I think it would be wise

466
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,610
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

467
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,696
Sorry, milady.

468
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:55,118
Perfect. It's settled, then.

469
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:12,052
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

470
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:13,679
Our missing planet Kamino.

471
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,760
Master Jedi.

472
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:57,180
The prime minister is expecting you.

473
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:00,934
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

474
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,187
He is anxious to meet you.

475
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:06,314
After all these years,

476
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,693
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

477
00:42:09,776 --> 00:42:12,279
Now, please, this way.

478
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,461
May I present Lama Su,

479
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:30,047
prime minister of Kamino.

480
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,717
And this is Master Jedi...

481
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,761
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

482
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:39,097
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.

483
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,100
Please.

484
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,313
And now to business.

485
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:50,358
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.

486
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,445
200,000 units are ready,

487
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:56,073
with a million more well on the way.

488
00:42:56,698 --> 00:42:59,159
That's good news.

489
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:02,162
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas

490
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:05,624
that his order will be met on time.

491
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,834
I'm sorry. Master...

492
00:43:08,835 --> 00:43:13,298
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still
a leading member of the Jedi Council,

493
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:14,841
is he not?

494
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:18,720
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

495
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:22,724
Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.

496
00:43:23,016 --> 00:43:27,187
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

497
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,440
- The army?
- Yes.

498
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:35,612
A clone army, and I must say,
one of the finest we've ever created.

499
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:37,322
Tell me, Prime Minister,

500
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:40,242
when my master first
contacted you about the army,

501
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:42,494
did he say who it was for?

502
00:43:42,744 --> 00:43:44,287
Of course he did.

503
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,374
This army is for the Republic.

504
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:52,462
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

505
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:55,465
That's why I'm here.

506
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,572
We used to come here
for school retreat.

507
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:22,617
We would swim to that island every day.

508
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:25,495
I love the water.

509
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:34,254
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us

510
00:44:34,337 --> 00:44:37,382
and try to guess
the names of the birds singing.

511
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,387
I don't like sand.

512
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:46,766
It's coarse and rough and irritating,

513
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,852
and it gets everywhere.

514
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,315
Not like here.

515
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,234
Here, everything is soft...

516
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,613
And smooth.

517
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:38,443
No.

518
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,238
I shouldn't have done that.

519
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:44,699
I'm sorry.

520
00:45:58,546 --> 00:46:02,425
- Very impressive.
- I'd hoped you would be pleased.

521
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,806
Clones can think creatively.

522
00:46:07,889 --> 00:46:12,394
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

523
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:20,986
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

524
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:24,823
This group was created
about five years ago.

525
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,992
You mentioned
growth acceleration.

526
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,660
Oh, yes, it's essential.

527
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:32,080
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

528
00:46:32,163 --> 00:46:34,749
Now we can do it in half the time.

529
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:37,544
I see.

530
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:39,546
They are totally obedient,

531
00:46:39,629 --> 00:46:42,340
taking any order without question.

532
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,509
We modified their genetic structure

533
00:46:44,592 --> 00:46:47,971
to make them less independent
than the original host.

534
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:50,473
And who was the original host?

535
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,767
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

536
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,313
And where is this bounty hunter now?

537
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,982
Oh, we keep him here.

538
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,154
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable,

539
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,489
Fett demanded only one thing,

540
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:09,409
an unaltered clone for himself.

541
00:47:09,492 --> 00:47:11,953
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

542
00:47:12,662 --> 00:47:14,581
Pure genetic replication.

543
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:17,625
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile

544
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,712
and no growth acceleration.

545
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:23,673
I should very much
like to meet this Jango Fett.

546
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,552
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

547
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:48,323
Magnificent, aren't they?

548
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:56,498
I don't know.

549
00:47:56,581 --> 00:47:58,750
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

550
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:01,461
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

551
00:48:01,544 --> 00:48:03,713
They only work on the weak-minded.

552
00:48:05,131 --> 00:48:08,218
All right. I was 12.

553
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:11,638
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

554
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:14,557
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

555
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,310
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

556
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,729
All right, I get the picture.

557
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,648
Whatever happened to him?

558
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:24,692
I went into public service,
he went on to become an artist.

559
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,694
Maybe he was the smart one.

560
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,738
You really don't like politicians,
do you?

561
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,241
I like two or three,

562
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:33,410
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

563
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,624
I don't think the system works.

564
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:42,502
How would you have it work?

565
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:47,090
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem,

566
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:51,469
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people, and then do it.

567
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,054
That's exactly what we do.

568
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,598
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

569
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,684
Well, then they should be made to.

570
00:48:58,017 --> 00:48:59,602
By whom? Who's gonna make them?

571
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,688
- I don't know. Someone.
- You?

572
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:04,315
- Of course not me.
- But someone.

573
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,151
Someone wise.

574
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:10,029
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

575
00:49:11,322 --> 00:49:14,033
Well, if it works.

576
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:22,625
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

577
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,587
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

578
00:49:45,356 --> 00:49:46,357
Whoa.

579
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,836
Ani! Ani, are you all right?

580
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,334
Boba, is your father here?

581
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,419
Yep.

582
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,588
May we see him?

583
00:50:51,172 --> 00:50:52,507
Sure.

584
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,720
Dad, Taun We's here.

585
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,735
Jango, welcome back.

586
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,988
Was your trip productive?

587
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,156
Fairly.

588
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,743
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

589
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,080
He's come to check on our progress.

590
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:27,208
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

591
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:30,378
I'm just a simple man
trying to make my way in the universe.

592
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:34,132
Ever made your way
as far into the interior as Coruscant?

593
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,093
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

594
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,805
Possibly.

595
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:43,558
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

596
00:51:51,482 --> 00:51:52,483
Master who?

597
00:51:54,068 --> 00:51:56,613
Sifo-Dyas.

598
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,365
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

599
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,995
Never heard of him.

600
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:08,750
Really?

601
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:13,087
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

602
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,922
Curious.

603
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:20,011
Do you like your army?

604
00:52:21,846 --> 00:52:23,890
I look forward to seeing them in action.

605
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:28,686
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

606
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,606
Thank you for your time, Jango.

607
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:34,734
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

608
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:55,838
What is it, Dad?

609
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,884
Pack your things. We're leaving.

610
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:08,768
And when I got to them, we went into
aggressive negotiations. Thank you.

611
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:11,437
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

612
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,607
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

613
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:31,249
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

614
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:03,072
From the moment I met you,

615
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,950
all those years ago,

616
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:09,328
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

617
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,792
And now that I'm with you again,

618
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,919
I'm in agony.

619
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:23,926
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

620
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,971
The thought of not being with you,

621
00:54:27,638 --> 00:54:30,016
I can't breathe.

622
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:38,983
I'm haunted by the kiss
that you should never have given me.

623
00:54:39,066 --> 00:54:41,194
My heart is beating,

624
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:44,405
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

625
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,035
You are in my very soul,

626
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:51,204
tormenting me.

627
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:57,877
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

628
00:55:08,095 --> 00:55:11,974
If you are suffering as much as I am,
please, tell me.

629
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,103
I can't.

630
00:55:16,729 --> 00:55:19,899
We can't. It's just not possible.

631
00:55:19,982 --> 00:55:23,027
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

632
00:55:23,402 --> 00:55:25,446
No, you listen.

633
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,617
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

634
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,120
You're studying to become a Jed..
I'm a senator.

635
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,750
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion,

636
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:41,045
it'll take us to a place we cannot go,

637
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:43,798
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

638
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,842
Then you do feel something.

639
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:48,928
I will not let you
give up your future for me.

640
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:51,264
You are asking me to be rational.

641
00:55:52,056 --> 00:55:54,725
That is something I know I cannot do.

642
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:59,438
Believe me, I wish that I could just
wish away my feelings,

643
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,399
but I can't.

644
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,236
I will not give in to this.

645
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:14,203
Well, you know, it...

646
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,373
Wouldn't have to be that way.

647
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,501
We could keep it a secret.

648
00:56:21,502 --> 00:56:23,880
We'd be living a lie,

649
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,048
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

650
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,302
I couldn't do that.

651
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:32,638
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

652
00:56:34,515 --> 00:56:38,060
No. You're right.

653
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,355
It would destroy us.

654
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:52,408
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

655
00:56:52,491 --> 00:56:56,120
And remind them,
if they need more troops,

656
00:56:56,203 --> 00:56:59,123
it will take more time to grow them.

657
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:02,001
- I won't forget, and thank you.
- Thank you.

658
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,187
R4!

659
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:24,941
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

660
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,907
I have
successfully made contact

661
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:34,575
with the prime minister of Kamino.

662
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,328
<i>They are using a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett</i>

663
00:57:37,411 --> 00:57:38,746
to create a clone army.

664
00:57:39,163 --> 00:57:41,165
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter

665
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:43,626
is the assassin we are looking for.

666
00:57:43,709 --> 00:57:45,169
Do you think these cloners are involved

667
00:57:45,252 --> 00:57:47,838
in the plot to
assassinate Senator Amidala?

668
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:50,800
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

669
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,886
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

670
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:56,764
Clear your mind must be

671
00:57:56,847 --> 00:58:01,227
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

672
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,895
Yes, Master.

673
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:06,315
They say Master Sifo-Dyas
placed an order for a clone army

674
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:10,194
at the request of the Senate
almost ten years ago.

675
00:58:12,613 --> 00:58:15,783
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

676
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:19,286
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

677
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,288
No. Whoever placed that order

678
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,708
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

679
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:28,170
Bring him here. Question him we will.

680
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:32,091
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

681
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:37,304
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army

682
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,265
we could not see.

683
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,520
I think it is time
we informed the Senate

684
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:46,981
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

685
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:52,111
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

686
00:58:52,194 --> 00:58:54,196
If informed the Senate is,

687
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,074
multiply our adversaries will.

688
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:01,037
No.

689
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,372
- No.
- Anakin! Help me!

690
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,707
Mom, no.

691
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:07,752
- Anakin!
- Don't.

692
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,337
No.

693
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,633
No.

694
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:36,572
Don't go.

695
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,868
I don't want to disturb you.

696
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,954
Your presence is soothing.

697
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,001
You had another nightmare last night.

698
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,588
Jedi don't have nightmares.

699
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,715
I heard you.

700
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,181
I saw my mother.

701
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,228
She is suffering, Padmé.

702
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:12,691
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

703
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:25,913
She is in pain.

704
01:00:27,456 --> 01:00:31,127
I know I'm disobeying
my mandate to protect you, Senator,

705
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,754
but I have to go.

706
01:00:36,048 --> 01:00:38,092
I have to help her.

707
01:00:39,718 --> 01:00:41,720
I'll go with you.

708
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:44,515
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

709
01:00:55,442 --> 01:00:57,111
Dad, look!

710
01:00:58,028 --> 01:01:00,114
Boba, get on board!

711
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,192
Oh, not good.

712
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:30,616
- Wait right there.
- Okey-okey.

713
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,375
Let me help you with that.

714
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:44,004
What? What do you want?

715
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:46,465
Wait! You're a Jedi!

716
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,718
Whatever it is... I didn't do it.

717
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:57,810
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

718
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:02,481
Ani?

719
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,734
Little Ani?

720
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,572
Ah...

721
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:16,537
You are Ani! It is you!

722
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:20,666
You sure sprouted, huh?

723
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:24,711
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

724
01:05:25,295 --> 01:05:30,426
Hey, maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

725
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,136
My mother.

726
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:35,681
Oh, yeah. Shmi. Uh...

727
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:39,518
She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

728
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:41,728
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

729
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:45,732
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business, huh?

730
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,611
Yeah, I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

731
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,030
At least I think it was Lars.

732
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:55,617
Believe it or not,
I heard he freed her and married her!

733
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:59,163
Can ya beat that? Yeah.

734
01:06:00,747 --> 01:06:02,541
Do you know where they are now?

735
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,544
Long way from here.

736
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:10,257
Some place over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

737
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:12,426
I'd like to know.

738
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:16,638
Sure. Absolutely!

739
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,892
Let's go look at my records, huh?

740
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:51,381
Dad! I think we're being tracked!

741
01:06:51,673 --> 01:06:54,885
He must have put a homing device
on our hull.

742
01:06:54,968 --> 01:06:57,221
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field,

743
01:06:57,721 --> 01:07:00,516
and we'll have a couple
of surprises for him.

744
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:14,863
Seismic charges! Stand by.

745
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:42,683
He doesn't seem to take a hint,
this guy.

746
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:02,703
Watch out!

747
01:08:22,347 --> 01:08:24,933
Get him, Dad! Get him! Fire!

748
01:08:27,352 --> 01:08:29,563
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

749
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:53,170
- We got him!
- We'll just have to finish him.

750
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,616
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

751
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:28,038
Fire them now!

752
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:43,970
Well, we won't be seeing him again.

753
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:20,549
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

754
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:44,948
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

755
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:22,903
Stay with the ship, R2.

756
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,125
Oh.

757
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:41,755
Hello. How might I be of service?
I am C...

758
01:11:41,838 --> 01:11:43,381
3PO?

759
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,511
The maker!

760
01:11:47,594 --> 01:11:50,639
Master Ani! I knew you would return.

761
01:11:50,722 --> 01:11:54,142
I knew it! And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

762
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:55,602
Hello, 3PO.

763
01:11:56,186 --> 01:11:59,689
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

764
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:01,566
I've come to see my mother.

765
01:12:01,858 --> 01:12:03,318
Oh.

766
01:12:03,401 --> 01:12:06,154
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

767
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:13,119
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

768
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:15,455
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

769
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:20,126
Owen Lars. This is my girlfriend, Beru.

770
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,046
- Hello.
- I'm Padmé.

771
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:25,382
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

772
01:12:25,465 --> 01:12:28,385
I had a feeling you
might show up someday.

773
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,973
- Is my mother here?
- No, she's not.

774
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:37,018
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife.

775
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,148
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

776
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:52,826
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

777
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:56,705
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

778
01:12:56,788 --> 01:12:59,791
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did,

779
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,378
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

780
01:13:03,461 --> 01:13:08,133
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home

781
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:09,342
when they took her.

782
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:12,971
Those Tuskens walk like men,

783
01:13:13,054 --> 01:13:17,851
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

784
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:22,689
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

785
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,819
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg,

786
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:33,450
I just couldn't ride
anymore until I heal.

787
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,286
I don't want to give up on her,

788
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:39,205
but she's been gone a month.

789
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:43,418
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

790
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:49,257
Where are you going?

791
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:51,384
To find my mother.

792
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:56,181
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

793
01:14:17,827 --> 01:14:20,080
You're gonna have to stay here.

794
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:24,167
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

795
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:25,418
Anakin...

796
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:38,264
I won't be long.

797
01:16:27,373 --> 01:16:29,334
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild

798
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:31,669
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

799
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:35,298
What about the senator
from Naboo?

800
01:16:35,381 --> 01:16:37,842
Is she dead yet?

801
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:41,679
I am not signing your treaty until
I have her head on my desk.

802
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:44,349
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

803
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:47,644
With these new battle droids
we've built for you,

804
01:16:47,727 --> 01:16:50,939
you'll have the finest
army in the galaxy.

805
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:03,201
As I explained to you earlier,

806
01:17:03,284 --> 01:17:07,205
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems

807
01:17:07,288 --> 01:17:09,624
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

808
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:13,503
What you are proposing could be construed as treason.

809
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:19,884
The Techno Union army...

810
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,387
...is at your disposal, Count.

811
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:26,975
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

812
01:17:27,058 --> 01:17:28,768
Good. Very good.

813
01:17:29,769 --> 01:17:33,356
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support,

814
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:36,276
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours,

815
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:40,238
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

816
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:44,200
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

817
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:48,454
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

818
01:18:47,096 --> 01:18:48,723
Mom.

819
01:18:48,806 --> 01:18:50,850
Mom? Mom?

820
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,896
Ani?

821
01:18:56,397 --> 01:19:00,777
Ani? Is it you?

822
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:05,114
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

823
01:19:06,157 --> 01:19:07,992
Ani?

824
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:10,787
Ani?

825
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,249
You look so handsome.

826
01:19:17,543 --> 01:19:19,754
My son.

827
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:23,091
My grown-up son.

828
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,469
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

829
01:19:26,886 --> 01:19:28,846
I missed you.

830
01:19:30,848 --> 01:19:33,434
Now I am complete.

831
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,485
I love ...

832
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:46,406
Stay with me, Mom. Everything...

833
01:19:46,489 --> 01:19:48,616
I love...

834
01:19:50,034 --> 01:19:52,829
I... I love...

835
01:20:49,927 --> 01:20:54,557
Anakin! Anakin! No!

836
01:21:14,827 --> 01:21:16,037
What is it?

837
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:20,708
Pain, suffering,

838
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:23,169
death I feel.

839
01:21:27,548 --> 01:21:31,427
Something terrible has happened.

840
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:38,267
Young Skywalker is in pain.
Terrible pain.

841
01:21:43,606 --> 01:21:46,567
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

842
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:49,654
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

843
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,408
We'll have to try something else.

844
01:21:55,868 --> 01:22:00,998
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo. It's much closer.

845
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:05,253
Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

846
01:22:05,336 --> 01:22:08,297
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

847
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:10,675
He's not on Naboo, R4.

848
01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:14,804
I'm going to try and widen the range.

849
01:22:18,057 --> 01:22:19,725
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

850
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,193
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right,

851
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:33,197
but it's coming from Tatooine.

852
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,700
What in the blazes is he doing there?

853
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:37,743
I told him to stay on Naboo.

854
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:42,915
We haven't got much time.

855
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:45,460
Anakin? Anakin, do you copy?

856
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:47,628
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

857
01:22:55,678 --> 01:22:57,472
Retransmit this message...

858
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:02,185
Anakin, do you copy? Anakin...

859
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,520
My long-range has been knocked out.

860
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,856
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

861
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:53,736
I brought you something.

862
01:23:54,111 --> 01:23:55,947
Are you hungry?

863
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,534
The shifter broke.

864
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:04,830
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

865
01:24:06,832 --> 01:24:10,378
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

866
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,674
But I couldn't...

867
01:24:18,427 --> 01:24:20,680
Why'd she have to die?

868
01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:25,768
Why couldn't I save her?

869
01:24:25,851 --> 01:24:27,937
I know I could have!

870
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:33,651
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

871
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:38,072
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

872
01:24:40,616 --> 01:24:42,785
Someday I will be.

873
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:45,913
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever!

874
01:24:47,331 --> 01:24:49,166
I promise you.

875
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:52,545
I will even learn to
stop people from dying.

876
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:54,755
Anakin.

877
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,801
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!

878
01:24:58,884 --> 01:25:01,929
He's jealous! He's holding me back!

879
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:08,894
What's wrong, Ani?

880
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,193
I...

881
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,616
I killed them.

882
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:24,994
I killed them all.

883
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,998
They're dead.

884
01:25:29,081 --> 01:25:31,459
Every single one of them.

885
01:25:33,085 --> 01:25:35,212
And not just the men,

886
01:25:36,964 --> 01:25:39,175
but the women

887
01:25:39,258 --> 01:25:41,302
and the children too.

888
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:46,974
They're like animals,
and I slaughtered them like animals!

889
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:50,353
I hate them!

890
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,164
To be angry is to be human.

891
01:26:10,956 --> 01:26:12,958
I'm a Jedi.

892
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:15,211
I know I'm better than this.

893
01:26:28,974 --> 01:26:33,813
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

894
01:26:33,896 --> 01:26:38,901
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

895
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:43,989
Good-bye, my darling wife.

896
01:26:48,077 --> 01:26:49,954
And thank you.

897
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:20,025
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

898
01:27:22,486 --> 01:27:24,029
I wasn't strong enough.

899
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:32,121
But I promise I won't fail again.

900
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:44,884
I miss you...

901
01:27:46,343 --> 01:27:47,928
So much.

902
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:57,772
R2? What are you doing here?

903
01:28:00,232 --> 01:28:04,862
It seems that he is carrying a message
from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

904
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:09,158
Master Ani,
does that name mean anything to you?

905
01:28:11,118 --> 01:28:13,829
Anakin, my long-range
transmitter has been knocked out.

906
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:16,165
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

907
01:28:20,252 --> 01:28:22,546
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett,

908
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:25,049
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

909
01:28:25,132 --> 01:28:28,427
The Trade Federation is to take
delivery of a droid army here,

910
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:30,846
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray

911
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:34,391
Is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

912
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:36,310
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance

913
01:28:36,393 --> 01:28:40,064
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming a...

914
01:28:40,147 --> 01:28:42,399
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

915
01:28:53,702 --> 01:28:58,040
More happening on Geonosis,
I feel, than has been revealed.

916
01:28:58,123 --> 01:29:00,042
I agree.

917
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:03,254
Anakin, we will deal with Count Dooku.

918
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:07,258
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

919
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:10,010
<i>Protect the senator at all costs.</i>

920
01:29:10,302 --> 01:29:13,222
That is your first priority.

921
01:29:14,181 --> 01:29:16,141
Understood, Master.

922
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:17,643
They'll never get there in time
to save him.

923
01:29:17,768 --> 01:29:21,605
They have to come
halfway across the galaxy. Look.

924
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:25,943
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

925
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:28,279
If he's still alive.

926
01:29:29,655 --> 01:29:32,116
Ani, are you just
gonna sit here and let him die?

927
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:33,784
He's your friend, your mentor. He's...

928
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:35,035
He's like my father!

929
01:29:36,203 --> 01:29:40,124
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here!

930
01:29:40,499 --> 01:29:43,168
He gave you strict orders to protect me,

931
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:45,796
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

932
01:29:46,922 --> 01:29:50,342
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

933
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:58,142
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

934
01:30:08,068 --> 01:30:09,570
The Commerce Guilds
are preparing for war.

935
01:30:09,653 --> 01:30:10,946
There can be no doubt of that.

936
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:12,907
Count Dooku
must have made a treaty with them.

937
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:16,285
The debate is over!

938
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:19,413
Now we need that clone army.

939
01:30:19,872 --> 01:30:22,625
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

940
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:27,046
The Senate will never approve the use
of clones before the separatists attack.

941
01:30:27,129 --> 01:30:28,839
This is a crisis.

942
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:31,926
The Senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

943
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:35,763
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

944
01:30:35,846 --> 01:30:38,140
But what senator
would have the courage

945
01:30:38,223 --> 01:30:40,726
to propose such a radical amendment?

946
01:30:41,143 --> 01:30:45,314
If only Senator Amidala were here.

947
01:30:46,565 --> 01:30:47,650
Hmm.

948
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,795
Traitor.

949
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:12,049
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

950
01:31:12,132 --> 01:31:14,134
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

951
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:16,762
I thought you were the leader here,
Dooku.

952
01:31:17,179 --> 01:31:19,473
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

953
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:22,977
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

954
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:26,647
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

955
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:30,693
May I ask why a Jedi knight

956
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:33,153
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

957
01:31:33,737 --> 01:31:36,156
I've been tracking
a bounty hunter named Jango Fett.

958
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:37,783
Do you know him?

959
01:31:37,866 --> 01:31:40,786
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

960
01:31:40,869 --> 01:31:42,621
The Geonosians don't trust them.

961
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:45,916
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

962
01:31:46,959 --> 01:31:51,463
It's a great pity that our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

963
01:31:52,172 --> 01:31:54,717
Qui-Gon always
spoke very highly of you.

964
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:01,473
I wish he were still alive.

965
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:05,310
I could use his help right now.

966
01:32:06,228 --> 01:32:08,188
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

967
01:32:10,274 --> 01:32:13,152
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

968
01:32:13,235 --> 01:32:16,280
You forget that he was once
my apprentice,

969
01:32:16,363 --> 01:32:18,574
just as you were once his.

970
01:32:19,324 --> 01:32:21,285
He knew all about
the corruption in the Senate,

971
01:32:21,368 --> 01:32:22,828
but he would never
have gone along with it

972
01:32:22,911 --> 01:32:24,621
if he had learned the truth as I have.

973
01:32:24,913 --> 01:32:27,416
- The truth?
- The truth.

974
01:32:33,839 --> 01:32:35,299
What if I told you that the Republic

975
01:32:35,382 --> 01:32:38,927
was now under the control
of the dark lord of the Sith?

976
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:42,306
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

977
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:47,394
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

978
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:50,314
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence

979
01:32:50,397 --> 01:32:54,777
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

980
01:32:55,819 --> 01:32:57,738
I don't believe you.

981
01:32:57,821 --> 01:32:59,865
The viceroy of the Trade Federation

982
01:32:59,948 --> 01:33:04,369
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious,

983
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:08,332
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

984
01:33:08,415 --> 01:33:11,460
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

985
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:16,006
You must join me, Obi-Wan,

986
01:33:16,465 --> 01:33:20,761
and together we will destroy the Sith!

987
01:33:22,262 --> 01:33:24,932
I will never join you, Dooku.

988
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:37,236
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

989
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:47,996
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact

990
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,374
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

991
01:33:50,457 --> 01:33:54,795
Senators, dellow felagates...

992
01:33:54,878 --> 01:33:59,383
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic,

993
01:34:00,008 --> 01:34:03,137
mesa propose that the Senate

994
01:34:03,303 --> 01:34:06,473
give immediately emergency powers

995
01:34:06,557 --> 01:34:09,518
to the supreme chancellor.

996
01:34:11,436 --> 01:34:15,774
Palpatine! Palpatine! Palpatine!

997
01:34:19,027 --> 01:34:22,322
Order! We shall have order!

998
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:26,827
It is with great reluctance

999
01:34:26,910 --> 01:34:29,413
that I have agreed to this calling.

1000
01:34:30,455 --> 01:34:34,626
I love democracy. I love the Republic.

1001
01:34:36,044 --> 01:34:37,754
The power you give me,

1002
01:34:37,963 --> 01:34:42,467
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1003
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:51,476
And as my first act
with this new authority,

1004
01:34:52,102 --> 01:34:56,231
I will create a grand army
of the Republic

1005
01:34:56,899 --> 01:35:00,736
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1006
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,989
- It is done, then.
- Hmm.

1007
01:35:08,452 --> 01:35:12,372
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1008
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:17,377
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino,

1009
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:21,298
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1010
01:35:41,443 --> 01:35:43,654
See those columns
of steam straight ahead?

1011
01:35:43,737 --> 01:35:45,781
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1012
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:48,075
That'll do.

1013
01:35:57,918 --> 01:36:01,213
Look, whatever happens out there,
follow my lead.

1014
01:36:01,296 --> 01:36:03,507
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1015
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:04,675
As a member of the Senate,

1016
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:07,594
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1017
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:12,516
Don't worry.
I've given up trying to argue with you.

1018
01:36:18,063 --> 01:36:21,149
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help,

1019
01:36:21,233 --> 01:36:23,235
they would have asked for it.

1020
01:36:23,318 --> 01:36:26,571
You obviously have a great deal to learn
about human behavior.

1021
01:36:52,389 --> 01:36:53,390
For a mechanic,

1022
01:36:53,473 --> 01:36:55,559
you seem to do an excessive
amount of thinking.

1023
01:36:57,686 --> 01:37:00,230
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1024
01:37:03,775 --> 01:37:05,527
"What does that mean?"

1025
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:08,530
That means I am in charge here!

1026
01:37:08,613 --> 01:37:11,616
Where are you going now?
You don't know what's out there.

1027
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:15,203
Have you no sense at all? Idiot!

1028
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:19,583
Please wait.

1029
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:22,419
Do you know where you're going?

1030
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,433
Wait.

1031
01:37:45,275 --> 01:37:47,152
Oh, my...

1032
01:37:57,579 --> 01:37:59,289
Padmé!

1033
01:38:52,217 --> 01:38:55,846
Oh, my goodness! Shut me down!

1034
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,682
Machines making machines.

1035
01:38:59,641 --> 01:39:00,976
How perverse. Oh!

1036
01:39:01,977 --> 01:39:05,397
Calm down, R2. I almost fell.

1037
01:39:05,605 --> 01:39:07,315
You'll get your chance...

1038
01:39:09,734 --> 01:39:11,278
I'm scrap.

1039
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:14,656
It's a nightmare!

1040
01:39:16,908 --> 01:39:18,618
I want to go home!

1041
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:22,122
What did I do to deserve this?

1042
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:04,247
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1043
01:40:04,581 --> 01:40:06,666
He's always getting
himself into trouble.

1044
01:40:08,376 --> 01:40:09,669
Oh, no!

1045
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:20,514
Uh-oh.

1046
01:40:24,851 --> 01:40:26,478
I'm so confused.

1047
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:23,803
Not again.

1048
01:42:24,679 --> 01:42:26,389
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1049
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:38,485
Don't move, Jedi! Take him away.

1050
01:42:57,879 --> 01:42:59,506
Don't be afraid.

1051
01:43:00,882 --> 01:43:03,259
I'm not afraid to die.

1052
01:43:07,972 --> 01:43:12,143
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1053
01:43:13,728 --> 01:43:15,897
What are you talking about?

1054
01:43:17,148 --> 01:43:19,651
I love you.

1055
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:25,281
You love me?

1056
01:43:29,828 --> 01:43:33,123
I thought that we had decided
not to fall in love,

1057
01:43:34,874 --> 01:43:38,628
that we would be forced to live a lie

1058
01:43:38,878 --> 01:43:41,798
and that it would destroy our lives.

1059
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:45,468
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1060
01:43:49,764 --> 01:43:51,349
I truly,

1061
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:55,687
deeply love you,

1062
01:43:56,771 --> 01:43:59,899
and before we die, I want you to know.

1063
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,917
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1064
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,587
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1065
01:45:04,255 --> 01:45:06,174
Then we decided to come
and rescue you.

1066
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:08,885
Good job.

1067
01:45:20,897 --> 01:45:24,108
Settle down. Settle down.

1068
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:31,324
Let the executions begin.

1069
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:07,569
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1070
01:46:33,177 --> 01:46:35,430
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1071
01:46:35,847 --> 01:46:37,765
She seems to be on top of things.

1072
01:47:40,995 --> 01:47:44,499
She can't do that!
Shoot her or something!

1073
01:49:03,911 --> 01:49:04,954
Jump!

1074
01:49:10,585 --> 01:49:11,586
Hyah!

1075
01:49:29,187 --> 01:49:34,400
This isn't how it's supposed to be!
Jango! Finish her off!

1076
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:38,905
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1077
01:50:08,392 --> 01:50:12,480
Master Windu,
how pleasant of you to join us.

1078
01:50:12,563 --> 01:50:14,440
This party's over.

1079
01:50:28,454 --> 01:50:33,126
Brave but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1080
01:50:33,209 --> 01:50:37,296
- You're impossibly outnumbered.
- I don't think so.

1081
01:50:37,713 --> 01:50:38,756
We'll see.

1082
01:51:17,336 --> 01:51:20,089
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1083
01:51:59,462 --> 01:52:02,256
What's all this noise? A battle!

1084
01:52:02,465 --> 01:52:04,467
There's been some terrible mistake!

1085
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:07,345
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1086
01:53:35,391 --> 01:53:38,561
Die, Jedi dogs! What did I say?

1087
01:53:48,154 --> 01:53:51,073
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1088
01:53:56,787 --> 01:53:59,623
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1089
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:15,348
You call this a diplomatic solution?

1090
01:54:15,431 --> 01:54:17,600
No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1091
01:54:22,646 --> 01:54:23,647
Uh-oh.

1092
01:54:23,731 --> 01:54:24,857
Roger, roger.

1093
01:54:43,459 --> 01:54:45,211
R2, what are you doing here?

1094
01:54:48,547 --> 01:54:50,966
What are you doing? Stop that!

1095
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:53,761
You're going to strain something.
My neck!

1096
01:54:56,597 --> 01:54:59,642
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag.

1097
01:55:05,314 --> 01:55:06,607
I'm quite beside myself.

1098
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:18,661
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1099
01:55:20,121 --> 01:55:22,748
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1100
01:55:45,396 --> 01:55:49,358
Master Windu,
you have fought gallantly,

1101
01:55:50,443 --> 01:55:55,698
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1102
01:55:56,699 --> 01:56:00,035
Now it is finished.

1103
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:06,083
Surrender,
and your lives will be spared.

1104
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:10,546
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1105
01:56:10,629 --> 01:56:14,800
Then, I'm sorry, old friend.

1106
01:56:26,437 --> 01:56:27,855
Look!

1107
01:56:38,491 --> 01:56:42,870
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1108
01:57:39,301 --> 01:57:42,471
I've had the most peculiar dream.

1109
01:57:53,065 --> 01:57:54,942
If Dooku escapes,

1110
01:57:55,359 --> 01:57:58,779
rally more systems to his cause he will.

1111
01:58:03,576 --> 01:58:04,868
Hold on!

1112
01:58:09,957 --> 01:58:11,917
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1113
01:58:18,757 --> 01:58:21,010
Good call, my young Padawan.

1114
01:58:34,398 --> 01:58:36,817
The Jedi have
amassed a huge army.

1115
01:58:37,151 --> 01:58:38,986
That doesn't seem possible.

1116
01:58:39,069 --> 01:58:41,697
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1117
01:58:41,780 --> 01:58:45,826
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1118
01:58:45,909 --> 01:58:47,161
There are too many.

1119
01:58:48,454 --> 01:58:51,040
Our communications have been jammed.

1120
01:58:59,089 --> 01:59:02,134
- Pilot, land in that assembly area!
- Yes, Sir.

1121
01:59:11,894 --> 01:59:15,689
Sir, I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1122
01:59:17,066 --> 01:59:20,653
To the forward
command center take me.

1123
01:59:43,717 --> 01:59:46,053
Attack those Federation starships!
Quickly!

1124
01:59:57,147 --> 02:00:00,943
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1125
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:05,406
Very good. Very good.

1126
02:00:33,142 --> 02:00:35,519
This is not looking good at all!

1127
02:00:36,979 --> 02:00:40,274
We must get the starships
back into space.

1128
02:00:43,152 --> 02:00:46,989
We have to order a retreat.

1129
02:00:47,406 --> 02:00:49,116
My master will never allow the Republic

1130
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:50,534
to get away with this treachery.

1131
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:55,205
I'm sending my warriors to hide in the catacombs.

1132
02:00:55,956 --> 02:01:00,335
The Jedi must not find our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1133
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:07,134
If they find out what we are planning to build, we're doomed.

1134
02:01:10,137 --> 02:01:12,514
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1135
02:01:13,640 --> 02:01:17,060
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1136
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:15,410
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1137
02:02:16,161 --> 02:02:17,371
Yes, sir.

1138
02:02:18,247 --> 02:02:20,999
Move all quadrants to sector 5-1-5.

1139
02:03:01,999 --> 02:03:03,000
Look over there!

1140
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,672
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1141
02:03:09,256 --> 02:03:10,883
We're out of rockets, sir.

1142
02:03:11,091 --> 02:03:13,802
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1143
02:03:13,886 --> 02:03:17,806
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1144
02:03:37,117 --> 02:03:38,285
Padmé!

1145
02:03:41,747 --> 02:03:44,124
- Put the ship down!
- Anakin!

1146
02:03:44,207 --> 02:03:48,003
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way! Follow that speeder!

1147
02:03:54,051 --> 02:03:56,178
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1148
02:03:56,261 --> 02:03:59,973
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1149
02:04:00,307 --> 02:04:03,101
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1150
02:04:03,185 --> 02:04:05,395
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1151
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:08,357
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1152
02:04:08,440 --> 02:04:11,360
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1153
02:04:16,031 --> 02:04:17,407
She would do her duty.

1154
02:04:27,042 --> 02:04:29,086
The droid army is in full retreat.

1155
02:04:29,169 --> 02:04:32,297
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1156
02:04:59,324 --> 02:05:02,285
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1157
02:05:02,703 --> 02:05:04,329
We'll take him together.
Go in slowly on the left.

1158
02:05:04,413 --> 02:05:05,497
I'm taking him now!

1159
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:08,000
No, Anakin! No! No!

1160
02:05:14,214 --> 02:05:17,968
As you see,
my Jedi powers are far beyond yours.

1161
02:05:18,051 --> 02:05:20,554
Now back down.

1162
02:05:25,851 --> 02:05:27,686
I don't think so.

1163
02:05:40,532 --> 02:05:43,243
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1164
02:05:43,326 --> 02:05:46,455
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1165
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,209
Surely you can do better.

1166
02:06:02,387 --> 02:06:05,015
- Are you all right?
- Uh-huh.

1167
02:06:07,059 --> 02:06:09,102
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.

1168
02:06:09,186 --> 02:06:10,812
No. No.

1169
02:06:11,354 --> 02:06:14,316
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1170
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:17,569
- Get a transport. Hurry!
- Right away.

1171
02:06:43,386 --> 02:06:44,638
Brave of you, boy.

1172
02:06:46,264 --> 02:06:48,308
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1173
02:06:48,391 --> 02:06:50,685
- I am a slow learner.
- Anakin!

1174
02:07:52,581 --> 02:07:57,169
- Master Yoda.
- Count Dooku.

1175
02:07:57,544 --> 02:08:00,922
You have interfered
with our affairs for the last time.

1176
02:08:31,453 --> 02:08:34,998
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1177
02:08:35,332 --> 02:08:38,501
The dark side I sense in you.

1178
02:08:38,835 --> 02:08:41,713
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1179
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:44,841
Even you.

1180
02:08:59,397 --> 02:09:02,525
Much to learn you still have.

1181
02:09:03,151 --> 02:09:05,987
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided

1182
02:09:06,071 --> 02:09:09,282
by our knowledge of the Force...

1183
02:09:09,991 --> 02:09:12,827
...but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1184
02:09:54,411 --> 02:09:57,831
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1185
02:09:58,039 --> 02:09:59,874
This is just the beginning.

1186
02:11:14,657 --> 02:11:16,451
Anakin!

1187
02:12:32,694 --> 02:12:35,613
The Force is with us,
Master Sidious.

1188
02:12:35,697 --> 02:12:38,575
Welcome home,
Lord Tyranus.

1189
02:12:40,326 --> 02:12:42,871
You have done well.

1190
02:12:42,954 --> 02:12:44,998
I have good news for you, my lord.

1191
02:12:46,666 --> 02:12:50,044
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1192
02:12:50,128 --> 02:12:52,839
Everything is going as planned.

1193
02:13:03,016 --> 02:13:04,601
Do you believe
what Count Dooku said

1194
02:13:04,684 --> 02:13:07,437
about Sidious controlling the Senate?

1195
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,689
It doesn't feel right.

1196
02:13:09,772 --> 02:13:12,817
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1197
02:13:14,235 --> 02:13:15,820
Lies, deceit,

1198
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:19,657
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1199
02:13:19,741 --> 02:13:24,370
Nevertheless, I feel we should
keep a closer eye on the Senate.

1200
02:13:24,454 --> 02:13:26,498
I agree.

1201
02:13:27,749 --> 02:13:29,751
Where is your apprentice?

1202
02:13:29,959 --> 02:13:33,880
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1203
02:13:35,298 --> 02:13:38,676
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1204
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:40,845
Victory?

1205
02:13:41,763 --> 02:13:44,349
Victory, you say?

1206
02:13:44,432 --> 02:13:48,186
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1207
02:13:49,687 --> 02:13:53,024
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1208
02:13:54,609 --> 02:13:58,696
Begun the Clone War has.
